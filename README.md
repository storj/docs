## Running docs locally

To get started, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

You can start editing by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

## Global search

The docs include a global search that's powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `âŒ˜K` shortcut.

This feature requires no configuration, and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index. You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/markdoc/search.mjs` file.

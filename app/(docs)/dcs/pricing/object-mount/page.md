# Object Mount Pricing

## Overview

Storj's Object Mount can be **bundled** as an add-on for existing Object Store customers or licensed as a **stand-alone** product for use with other S3-compatible solutions.


## Object Mount: Bundled

Object Mount licenses can be added to either Object Store's new Global Collaboration tier or Regional Workflows tier. (Object Mount cannot be added to the Active Archive tier.)

Combining Object Mount with Object Store creates a bundle called Storj's "Production Cloud" offering.

|    | **Global Collaboration** | **Regional Workflows** |
| :- | :---------- | :---------- |
| **Use Case**          | For teams that collaborate and share media globally and need instant access to assets. | For enterprise teams with compliance or regional needs that collaborate and share media in a specific region. |
| **Cost: Object Storage only** (Object Store tier w/o Object Mount) | $15/TB/mo | $10/TB/mo |
| **Cost: Production Cloud Bundle** (Object Store tier w/ Object Mount)| $40/TB/mo | $30/TB/mo |
| **Egress**            | Included | Included |
| **Minimum Footprint** | 20 TB or more | 300 TB or more |
| **Licenses**          | 10 licenses | Starts at 15 licenses |

**Production Cloud: Regional Workflows - Add-on licenses:** 
- ~~MSRP $199~~ 
- Add-on licenses are available at early adopter pricing: $75/mo, billed annually ($895/yr)


## Object Mount: Stand-Alone

If you already have an S3 storage solution, Object Mount can add the convenience and productivity boost of mounting your cloud storage as a local drive.

Object Mount has two stand-alone licensing models available, depending on your size and storage footprint:

| **Licensing Model** | **Best For** | **Ideal Use Case** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Named End-user Licensing**  | Small, Medium and Large Accounts | Storage footprint less than 300 TB, or when customers prefer named end-user licensing. |
| **Footprint-based Licensing** | Very Large and Enterprise Accounts | Enterprise engagements at scale, with storage footprints of 300 TB or greater. |

**Details: Named End-user Licensing:**

# Pricing Overview

## New Offerings and New Object Storage Tiers

We’ve recently added new products, new capabilities, and have introduced simpler pricing tiers to make the Storj Platform an even easier choice for customers. 

**Changes include:**

- **New Object Storage tiers** that better support customer needs, simplify fees, and eliminate segment fees: 
- **Object Mount is now available**, allowing you to connect to your object storage as a local file system; optimized for peak performance with Storj’s Object Storage.
- **New Production Cloud offerings** that combine the unique benefits of Storj’s distributed cloud storage with local-like file access.
- **SOC2 Type 2 certification** has been achieved by Storj on specific storage offerings, reinforcing our commitment to delivering enterprise-grade security and privacy.

<!-- REMOVING FOR NOW
- **A new Cloud Compute offering** with CPUs and GPUs co-located alongside Storj’s Object Storage, for ultra-low latency, maximum performance, and no egress fees.
-->


## Simplified Pricing

Storj has consistent and competitive pricing that provides the global scale productions need &mdash; without scaling up your monthly bill.

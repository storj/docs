## New Offerings and New Object Storage Tiers

We've recently added new products, new capabilities, and have introduced simpler pricing tiers to make the Storj Platform an even easier choice for customers. 

**Changes include:**

- **New  Object Storage tiers** that better support customer needs, simplify fees, and eliminate segment fees: 
- **Object Mount is now available**, allowing you to connect to your object storage as a local file system; optimized for peak performance with Storj's Object Storage.
- **New Production Cloud offerings** that combine the unique benefits of Storj's distributed cloud storage with local-like file access.
- **A new Cloud Compute offering** with CPUs and GPUs co-located alongside Storj's Object Storage, for ultra-low latency, maximum performance, and no egress fees.
- **SOC2 Type 2 certification** has been achieved by Storj on specific storage offerings, reinforcing our commitment to delivering enterprise-grade security and privacy.

**What to know about the new object storage tiered pricing:**
- No action is needed at this time.
- **Existing Projects** created before November 1, 2025 will continue to use the current pricing model (Legacy Pricing) for a full additional year (through October 31, 2026).
- **New Projects** created on or after November 1, 2025 will be charged using the new model (Tiered Pricing).

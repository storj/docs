## Added Value from the The Storj Platform

In addition to favorable pricing, Object Storage by Storj offers significant economic benefits over the competition, including:

- **Flexible egress offerings** designed for real-world production environments & creating dynamic content, including streaming media workflows.

- **Global content distribution** eliminates inter-region transfer fees, removes the need for multi-region replication and avoids unnecessary CDN overlays.

- Storj's unique use of **erasure-coding and object segmentation** ensures redundancy, availability and high performance from any global region, removing the need for backups and replication.

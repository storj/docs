## Additional Pricing Notes

Storj has a $5 minimum monthly usage fee for all object storage accounts.

This helps cover the cost of payment processing and basic operations so we can continue offering fast, secure, and reliable storageâ€”even for small accounts.

**What does this mean for you?**

- Any monthly usage that results in an invoice less than $5 will result in the minimum usage fee.
- If your usage exceeds $5 per month, you will not be charged a minimum usage fee.
- If you bought a starter package via a partner before August 1, 2025, you will not be charged a minimum usage fee until your starter package expires. The starter package expires one year from purchase or when the starter package credits have been fully used.
- If you pay with STORJ token, you will not be charged a minimum usage fee.

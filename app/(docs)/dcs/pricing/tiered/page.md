# Object Store: Tiered Pricing

## Overview

Beginning November 1, 2025, Storj now offers three new Object Storage pricing tiers that better support the expanding needs of our customers: 

- Global Collaboration
- Regional Workflows
- Active Archive

Storj customers and partners have asked for expanded, purpose-built storage offerings to meet the demands of modern media and streaming-focused workflows. These new tiers simplify our pricing models for more predictable billing, eliminate segment fees, and bundle-in egress (on most tiers).

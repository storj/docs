# Object Storage: Tiered Pricing

## Overview

Beginning November 1, 2025, Storj now offers three new object storage pricing tiers that better support the expanding needs of our customers: 

- Global Collaboration
- Regional Workflows
- Active Archive

Storj customers and partners have asked for expanded, purpose-built storage offerings to meet the demands of modern media use and streaming-focused workflows. These new tiers simplify our object storage pricing models, provide more predictable billing, eliminate segment fees, and include egress bandwidth (on most tiers).


## Object Storage Tiers

| **Best For** | Global teams needing high-speed performance. Powered by Storj's distributed edge network and redundant, global, low-latency coverage from  anywhere. | Region-specific storage built for regulatory compliance and predictable performance. Keeps data local while meeting data sovereignty requirements. | Cost-effective, region-based for long-term retention. Archive and backup data are instantly accessible without paying for peak performance.|
| **Storage Fees** | $15/TB/mo. | $10/TB/mo. | $6/TB/mo. |

## Integration

To integrate Storj with Commvault, you will need to create S3 credentials in Storj and add them within Commvault.

### Requirements

- An active Storj account
- A bucket for use with Commvault in your Storj instance
- An active Commvault account
- Commvault MediaAgent installed and connected to CommCell server or Metallic.io


Download a [free trial](https://www.commvault.com/free-trial-form) of Commvault or [sign up for a Demo](https://www.commvault.com/request-demo).

Trial users using Metallic.io may obtain a MediaAgent by performing a File Server installation.

### Create an Account

To begin, you will need to create a Storj account.

Navigate to <https://www.storj.io/signup?partner=commvault> to sign up, or log in <https://storj.io/login> if you already have an account.

### Create a Bucket

Once you have your Storj account you can create a bucket for your data to be stored in.

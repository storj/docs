  title: TrueNAS Integration with Storj for Secure Data Storage
  description:
    A guide to integrating TrueNAS storage solution with Storj for off-site
    backup, data durability, speed, and simplicity. Steps include creating a Storj
    account, setting up a bucket, and generating S3 credentials.
---

TrueNAS is a network attached storage (NAS) solution that allows for an off-site backup with cloud storage, such as Storj, to provide simplicity, speed, and durability in data storage.

## Advantages of Storj with TrueNAS

Using Storj with TrueNAS provides resilient cloud object storage with blazing performance and zero-trust security. This integration ensures:

1.  **Data durability**: Use Storj as an offsite backup for your TrueNAS storage for multi-region durability.

2.  **Speed and simplicity** of on-site storage with the added protection of a back-up in the cloud.

3.  It is also configurable in a variety of ways.

## Integration

This integration uses S3 credentials passed from Storj to TrueNAS. You will need to set up a Storj account, create a Storj bucket for TrueNAS, and generate S3 credentials for TrueNAS. Then, you will need to create a Cloud Credential on TrueNAS that will grant it access to the bucket in Storj.

### Software Requirements

Storj is fully integrated with TrueNAS.

To integrate TrueNAS with Storj, you will need:

- A Storj account

- A TrueNAS storage device connected to your network.

## Setting up Storj

### Sign up for an account

Navigate to <https://storj.io/signup?partner=ix-storj-1> to sign up iX-Storj account. Enter your full name, email address, and a password, as shown below:

{% callout type="warning"  %}
If you have an existing Storj account, you will need to contact support to have it linked to the iX Storj integration. See [here](https://forum.storj.io/t/truenas-backups-and-differences-between-storj-and-storj-ix/20044/7) for more information

### Create a Bucket

Once you have your Storj account you can create a bucket for your data to be stored in.

1\. Navigate to “Buckets” on the left side menu.

2\. Click “New Bucket” on the top right.

3\. Assign the bucket an easily identifiable name, such as "my-bucket".

4\. Click **Create bucket**

### Generate S3 credentials

Storj has an Amazon S3 compatible API and you'll need generate S3 credentials to use it. S3 credentials consist of an **access key**, **secret key**, and **endpoint**.

Create S3 credentials in the Storj web console:

1\. Navigate to **Access** on the left side menu.

2\. Click **Create S3 Credentials** under the S3 Credentials block.

3\. When the Create Access screen comes up, set specifications according to the following guidelines:

- **Type:** S3 Credentials

- **Name:** The name of the credentials (e.g. my-access)

4\. Click **Continue** to provide permissions

- **Permissions:** All

- **Buckets:** Feel free to specify the bucket you created above (e.g. my-bucket), or leave as “All”

- **End date**: provide an expiration date for these credentials (optional)

5\. Click **Continue** to provide Access encryption Information

- **Use the current passphrase**: this is default option

- **Advanced**: you may provide a different encryption phrase either your own or generate a new one.

  - **Enter a new passphrase**: use this option, if you would like to provide your own new encryption phrase

  - **Generate 12-word passphrase**: use this option, if you would like to generate a new encryption phrase

{% callout type="warning"  %}
In order to see the data uploaded to your bucket in the web console, you must unlock the bucket with the same encryption passphrase as the credentials.
{% /callout %}

6\. Click **Create Access** to finish creation of your S3 credentials

7\. Click **Confirm** the Confirm details pop-up message

8\. Your S3 credentials are created. Write them down and store them, or click the **Download all** button. You will need these credentials for the following steps.

  description: Comprehensive explanation of Storj's security model, encryption implementation, key management, and privacy protections.
---

Security forms the foundation of Storj's value proposition. Understanding how encryption, access control, and privacy protections work helps you make informed decisions about data protection and compliance requirements.

## Security Philosophy

Storj implements security through a "zero-trust" architecture where no single party - including Storj Labs - can access your data without your explicit permission. This approach provides stronger security guarantees than traditional cloud storage models.

### Core Security Principles

**Default Encryption**: All data is encrypted client-side before leaving your device. There is no option to store unencrypted data on the network.

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Network operators, storage node operators, and Storj Labs cannot decrypt your data or meaningful metadata.

**Client-Side Control**: You maintain complete control over encryption keys, access permissions, and data sharing decisions.

**Open Source Transparency**: Core components are open source, enabling independent security audits and verification.

## Encryption Implementation

### Multi-Layer Encryption

Storj implements multiple layers of encryption to protect different aspects of your data:

**Content Encryption:**
- Each file encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Unique random encryption key per file
- Authentication prevents tampering detection

**Path Encryption:**
- File paths and names encrypted separately
- Prevents metadata analysis attacks
- Hierarchical key derivation enables efficient access management

**Transport Encryption:**
- All network communication uses TLS 1.2+
- Protection against network-level attacks
- Certificate validation prevents man-in-the-middle attacks

### Encryption Process Flow

When you store a file, encryption happens in specific stages:

1. **Random Key Generation**: A cryptographically secure random key is generated for your specific file

2. **Content Encryption**: Your file content is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the random key

3. **Key Derivation**: The random key is encrypted using a key derived from your root secret and the file path

4. **Path Encryption**: The file path components are encrypted using hierarchically derived keys

5. **Secure Transmission**: Encrypted data and metadata are transmitted over TLS-protected connections

## Key Management Architecture

### Hierarchical Key Derivation

Storj uses a sophisticated key hierarchy that balances security with practical usability:

**Root Secret:**
- Master key stored only on client devices
- Never transmitted over the network
- Used to derive all other encryption keys

**Path Keys:**
- Derived from root secret and path components
- Each directory level has its own key
- Enables efficient sharing of directory trees

**Content Keys:**
- Random keys for actual file encryption
- Encrypted with path-derived keys
- Stored as encrypted metadata on Satellites

### Key Derivation Process

The key hierarchy works through cryptographic derivation:

```
Root Secret → Path Key (project) → Path Key (bucket) → Path Key (folder) → Content Key
```

This hierarchy provides several security benefits:

- **Forward Security**: Higher-level keys cannot be derived from lower-level ones
- **Efficient Sharing**: Share access to directory trees without exposing other data
- **Key Rotation**: Individual keys can be changed without affecting the entire hierarchy

### Access Grant System

Access Grants package together API permissions and encryption keys for secure sharing:

**Components:**
- **API Key**: Satellite authorization token with specific permissions
- **Encryption Store**: Collection of encryption keys for authorized paths
- **Satellite Address**: Network endpoint for metadata operations

**Capabilities:**
- Time-limited access (expiration dates)
- Path-restricted access (specific files or folders)
- Operation-limited access (read-only, write-only, etc.)
- Revocable access (can be disabled remotely)

## Cryptographic Algorithms

### Encryption Algorithms

**AES-256-GCM:**
- Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- 256-bit keys provide long-term security
- Built-in integrity protection
- Hardware acceleration available on most platforms

**Alternative Implementation:**
- **Secretbox** (NaCl library): Salsa20 + Poly1305
- Used in some client implementations
- Equivalent security level to AES-256-GCM

### Key Derivation Functions

**HMAC-based Derivation:**
- Uses cryptographic hash functions for key derivation
- One-way operation prevents key inference attacks
- Standardized implementation across client libraries

**Path-based Derivation:**
- Each path component contributes to key derivation
- Creates unique keys for every file and directory
- Enables fine-grained access control

## Privacy Protections

### Data Privacy

**Content Privacy:**
- File contents never visible to storage nodes or Satellites
- Erasure coding splits encrypted data into meaningless pieces
- No single storage location contains reconstructable data

**Metadata Privacy:**
- File names and paths encrypted client-side
- File sizes and timestamps protected through aggregation
- Usage patterns obscured through traffic analysis resistance

**Communication Privacy:**
- No correlation between user identity and stored data
- Satellite operators see only encrypted metadata
- Network analysis cannot reveal user behavior patterns

### Network-Level Privacy

**IP Address Protection:**
- Optional use of VPNs or Tor for additional anonymity
- Direct peer-to-peer connections to storage nodes
- No centralized traffic monitoring points

**Traffic Analysis Resistance:**
- Padding and timing randomization
- Decoy traffic options in some implementations
- Distributed access patterns across multiple nodes

## Access Control Security

### Capability-Based Access Control

Storj implements capability-based security where possession of valid credentials grants specific access rights:

**Access Grant Capabilities:**
- Self-contained authorization tokens
- Cannot be forged or replicated without private key access
- Specific permissions encoded cryptographically

**Caveat System:**
- Fine-grained restrictions on access grants
- Time-based limitations
- Path-based restrictions
- Operation-specific permissions

### Delegation and Sharing

**Secure Delegation:**
- Create restricted access grants from existing ones
- No need to share root credentials
- Hierarchical permission inheritance

**Revocation Mechanisms:**
- Satellite-level revocation for compromised access grants
- Time-based expiration for temporary access
- Path-specific revocation for granular control

## Threat Model and Protections

### Threat Scenarios

**Compromised Storage Nodes:**
- Encrypted pieces provide no useful information
- Erasure coding prevents reconstruction from partial data
- Geographic distribution limits exposure scope

**Compromised Satellites:**
- Encrypted metadata prevents data access
- No encryption keys stored on Satellites
- Users can migrate to alternative Satellites

**Network Attacks:**
- TLS encryption protects data in transit
- End-to-end encryption prevents intermediate tampering
- Distributed architecture eliminates single points of failure

**Government Surveillance:**
- Zero-knowledge architecture prevents mass surveillance
- No decrypt capabilities at service provider level
- International distribution complicates jurisdiction issues

### Attack Mitigations

**Cryptographic Attacks:**
- Use of proven, standardized encryption algorithms
- Regular security audits and updates
- Forward security through proper key rotation

---

The Storj network's reputation system ensures data reliability and network health by tracking Storage Node performance and rewarding consistent, high-quality service. Understanding how reputation works is essential for successful Storage Node operation and maximizing earnings.

## Reputation System Overview

The reputation system continuously monitors Storage Node behavior across multiple dimensions and uses these metrics to make decisions about data placement, payment allocation, and network participation eligibility.

### Core Design Principles

**Objective Measurement:**
- Performance metrics based on measurable technical criteria
- Automated scoring eliminates subjective evaluation
- Transparent calculation methods with published formulas

**Incentive Alignment:**
- Good performance increases earnings opportunities
- Poor performance reduces income and network participation
- Long-term reliability rewarded over short-term availability

**Network Protection:**
- Identifies and removes unreliable nodes before they cause data loss
- Prevents gaming through multiple interconnected metrics
- Maintains network integrity through proactive monitoring

### Trust and Verification Model

**Zero-Trust Architecture:**
- No node is inherently trusted regardless of operator reputation
- All nodes continuously prove their reliability through measurable actions
- Network protocols assume potential node failures and design around them

**Continuous Validation:**
- Real-time monitoring of all node interactions
- Historical performance tracking over extended periods
- Predictive analysis to identify potential future issues

## Key Reputation Metrics

The reputation system evaluates Storage Nodes across several critical performance dimensions, each contributing to overall network health and reliability.

### Uptime and Availability

**Uptime Measurement:**
- **Contact Success Rate**: Percentage of successful satellite communication attempts
- **Response Time**: Average time to respond to satellite requests
- **Availability Windows**: Performance during different time periods and network conditions

**Scoring Methodology:**
- Rolling average over recent time periods (typically 30-90 days)
- Weighted by recency (recent performance matters more)
- Minimum thresholds for continued network participation

**Impact on Operations:**
- High uptime increases data allocation from satellites
- Consistent availability builds long-term reputation
- Extended downtime triggers reputation penalties and reduced earnings

### Data Integrity and Audit Performance

**Audit System:**
- **Random Data Verification**: Satellites randomly request stored data pieces for verification
- **Cryptographic Validation**: Verify data hasn't been corrupted or tampered with
- **Response Accuracy**: Ensure correct data returned within expected timeframes

**Audit Success Metrics:**
- **Audit Score**: Percentage of successful audit responses over time
- **Critical Threshold**: Scores below 60% lead to node disqualification
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Nodes can improve scores through consistent good performance

**Data Protection Consequences:**
- Failed audits indicate potential data loss or corruption
- Multiple audit failures suggest systematic problems
- Disqualified nodes lose all stored data and accumulated earnings

### Bandwidth Performance

**Bandwidth Quality Metrics:**
- **Upload Speed**: Rate at which node can receive new data
- **Download Speed**: Rate at which customers can retrieve data
- **Consistency**: Variation in performance over time and conditions

**Performance Measurement:**
- **Throughput Testing**: Regular speed tests during actual data operations
- **Latency Analysis**: Round-trip time for requests and responses
- **Reliability Tracking**: Success rate for data transfer operations

**Impact on Earnings:**
- Faster nodes receive more customer download requests (higher egress earnings)
- Consistent performance increases satellite confidence and data allocation
- Poor bandwidth performance reduces competitiveness for network operations

### Suspension and Probationary Status

**Suspension Triggers:**
- Extended downtime (typically 7+ days offline)
- Repeated audit failures indicating data integrity issues
- Systematic performance problems affecting network operations

**Suspension Consequences:**
- **No New Data**: Satellites stop allocating new data to suspended nodes
- **Limited Earnings**: Only existing storage generates revenue, no new egress opportunities
- **Reputation Impact**: Suspension period affects long-term reputation scoring

**Recovery Process:**
- Demonstrate consistent good performance over extended period
- Address underlying issues causing suspension
- Gradual restoration of full network participation privileges

## Reputation Calculation and Scoring

### Scoring Algorithms

**Weighted Average Approach:**
```
Overall Reputation = (
  Uptime Score × 40% +
  Audit Score × 40% +
  Bandwidth Score × 20%
)
```

**Time-Weighted Calculations:**
- Recent performance weighted more heavily than historical performance
- Exponential decay of older performance data
- Minimum observation periods before reputation stabilizes

### Reputation Categories

**New Node (0-6 months):**
- **Vetting Period**: Extended observation before full network participation
- **Limited Data Allocation**: Gradual increase in stored data based on performance
- **Higher Scrutiny**: More frequent audits and monitoring during initial period

**Established Node (6+ months):**
- **Full Participation**: Eligible for complete range of network operations
- **Historical Context**: Long-term performance patterns influence scoring
- **Reputation Momentum**: Good reputation builds over time, providing resilience to occasional issues

**High-Reputation Node:**
- **Priority Selection**: Preferred for high-value or critical data storage
- **Increased Allocation**: More data and bandwidth opportunities
- **Network Recognition**: Acknowledged as reliable network participant

### Reputation Decay and Recovery

**Performance Decay:**
- Reputation slowly decreases without active positive performance
- Extended inactivity leads to reduced network trust
- Requires ongoing good performance to maintain high scores

**Recovery Mechanisms:**
- Consistent good performance gradually improves reputation
- Recovery time typically longer than initial reputation building
- Some reputation damage may have permanent components

## Strategic Reputation Management

We have a great [Community Earnings Estimator](https://forum.storj.io/t/realistic-earnings-estimator/6693) to give you an idea how much time it may take to fill your provided free disk space and how much you may earn.

Please be aware - this is only an estimator, not a calculator. Unlike for mining cryptocurrencies, the estimated potential earnings are not guaranteed because the space and bandwidth are used by real people, not machines.

**No**. You do not need to create an account to start earning STORJ tokens by renting your drive space.

All you need to do is run the storagenode software and [configure it properly](/node).

Note that [the V2 network has been shutdown in January 2020](https://forum.storj.io/t/v2-is-officially-shut-down/4250) as v3 in [Production](https://www.storj.io/blog/announcing-early-access-for-tardigrade) now, so it is not possible to start farming with new nodes on V2 anymore.

You can learn about how to sign up to become a Storage Node Operator on the V3 network [here](docId:kjMiGo7HTr4v_qwD5Iqc7).

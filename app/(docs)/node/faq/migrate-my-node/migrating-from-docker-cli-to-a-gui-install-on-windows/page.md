## Migrating from Docker CLI to a GUI Install on Windows

1\. Make sure the Docker version is stopped and removed.

2\. Move orders from the data location to the installation folder location (`"%ProgramFiles%\Storj\Storage Node\orders"` by default) (PowerShell):

```powershell
robocopy /MIR /MOVE D:\Storj\orders "$env:ProgramFiles\Storj\Storage Node\orders"
```

3\. Point to the same exact **storage** folder where you were previously storing the data.

{% callout type="warning"  %}
Do NOT copy the path from the old `config.yaml` or `source` part of the `--mount` option of your Docker node where the **storage** subfolder was not explicitly included in the path.

It is better to specify the path to the **storage** subfolder with the **Browse...** button.
{% /callout %}

4\. Verify the complete path to the correct **storage** folder on your hard drive.

{% callout type="danger"  %}
**If you choose a different folder, your previously stored data will not be recognized, and your node will be disqualified**.
{% /callout %}

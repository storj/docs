Here is walkthrough for one of the popular software wallet - [https://MyEtherWallet.com](https://MyEtherWallet.com) . The following step will let you create a valid STORJ token address if you do not already have one. If you already have a compatible STORJ payout address, or an address made with another ERC20 compatible wallet such as Metamask, Parity or Mist, you can skip this article.

First we will add a STORJ ERC20 payout address. STORJ is the name of the token which is used to pay the Operators for renting out their storage space. STORJ has a monetary value and divisibility which makes it suitable as a means of payment. To create a new payout address, you can use any compatible ethereum wallet; we use [https://www.myetherwallet.com/ (MEW)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) here as example. There are many other options available; Storj Labs does not endorse any particular wallet, please choose the one you are most comfortable with.

You have three options how to create a new wallet on MEW site

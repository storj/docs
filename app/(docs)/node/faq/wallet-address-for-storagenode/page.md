Here is walkthrough for one of the popular software wallet - [https://MyEtherWallet.com](https://MyEtherWallet.com) . The following step will let you create a valid STORJ token address if you do not already have one. If you already have a compatible STORJ payout address, or an address made with another ERC20 compatible wallet such as Metamask, Parity or Mist, you can skip this article.

First we will add a STORJ ERC20 payout address. STORJ is the name of the token which is used to pay the Operators for renting out their storage space. STORJ has a monetary value and divisibility which makes it suitable as a means of payment. To create a new payout address, you can use any compatible ethereum wallet; we use [https://www.myetherwallet.com/ (MEW)](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) here as example. There are many other options available; Storj Labs does not endorse any particular wallet, please choose the one you are most comfortable with.

You have three options how to create a new wallet on MEW site

Do NOT use an exchange wallet address, the micropayments wont work with an exchanges' deposit addresses.

You could lose your payments, if you would use an exchanges' deposit address instead of your wallet.

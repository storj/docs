STORJ is a utility token on the Ethereum network which follows the [ERC20 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20). STORJ tokens allow you to purchase storage or earn money for renting your free hard drive space regardless of where in the world you are located (the only exception are countries currently embargoed by the US government which for legal reasons Storj Labs cannot serve). STORJ token can be used directly on Ethereum blockchain for its transactions on Layer 1, and zkSync for transactions on Layer 2.

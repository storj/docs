{% callout type="warning"  %}

**Note:** An earlier version of these Node Setup instructions included a requirement to request an authorization token for the `identity authorize` command. 

This step is no longer required. 

Identities can now be used without authorizing them manually.

Please refer to the new and revised Node Setup steps: [](docId:kjMiGo7HTr4v_qwD5Iqc7)

  title: Understanding Object Mount vs Traditional Filesystems
  description: Conceptual explanation of how Object Mount bridges object storage and POSIX filesystems, with architecture and performance considerations.
---

Object Mount represents a fundamental shift in how applications access cloud storage by bridging the gap between POSIX filesystem expectations and object storage characteristics.

## The traditional filesystem model

Traditional applications expect filesystems to provide:

- **Hierarchical structure**: Files organized in directories and subdirectories
- **POSIX compliance**: Standard operations like open, read, write, close, and seek
- **Metadata support**: Permissions, timestamps, ownership, and symbolic links
- **Consistency guarantees**: Immediate visibility of changes across all processes
- **Random access**: Ability to read or write any part of a file efficiently

These expectations work well with local storage (HDDs, SSDs) and network filesystems (NFS, CIFS) but conflict with object storage design principles.

## Object storage characteristics

Object storage systems like Storj, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob Storage are designed for:

- **Write-once, read-many patterns**: Optimized for immutable data
- **High throughput**: Excellent for large file transfers and streaming
- **Eventual consistency**: Changes may not be immediately visible everywhere
- **Flat namespace**: Objects stored with keys, not hierarchical paths
- **HTTP-based access**: REST APIs rather than POSIX system calls

This fundamental mismatch means traditional applications cannot directly use object storage as if it were a local filesystem.

## How Object Mount solves the problem

Object Mount acts as a translation layer that:

### Intercepts system calls
- Uses `LD_PRELOAD` to intercept filesystem operations from applications
- Translates POSIX operations into object storage API calls
- Works with both dynamically and statically linked applications
- Requires no application modifications

### Maps filesystem concepts to objects
- **Files** → Individual objects in the bucket
- **Directories** → Object key prefixes (simulated hierarchy)  
- **Metadata** → Object metadata and special tracking objects
- **Permissions** → Cached and synchronized metadata

### Provides performance optimization
- **Intelligent caching**: Predicts access patterns and caches data locally
- **Write-behind caching**: Buffers writes for optimal object storage interaction
- **Partial reads**: Downloads only needed portions of large files
- **Concurrent operations**: Parallelizes uploads and downloads

## Architecture comparison

### Traditional application + local storage
```
Application → POSIX calls → Kernel VFS → Filesystem → Storage device
```

### Traditional application + Object Mount + object storage
```
Application → POSIX calls → Object Mount interception → Object storage API → Cloud storage
```

### Object Mount modes

**Direct Interception (CLI mode)**:
- Highest performance
- Full POSIX compatibility
- Works in containers and restricted environments
- Requires compatible applications

**FUSE mode**:
- Broader application compatibility
- Standard mount interface
- Slightly higher overhead
- Requires FUSE kernel module

**FlexMount (hybrid)**:
- Automatic fallback between modes
- Best of both approaches
- Optimal compatibility and performance

## Performance characteristics

### Object storage optimizations

**Read performance**:
- First access: Download time from object storage
- Subsequent access: Cache speed (near-local performance)
- Large files: Streaming and partial download optimization

**Write performance**:
- Small writes: Buffered and batched for efficiency
- Large writes: Direct streaming to object storage
- Metadata updates: Cached and synchronized

**Memory usage**:
- Configurable cache size
- Intelligent eviction policies
- Minimal overhead for inactive files

### When Object Mount excels

- **Read-heavy workloads**: Excellent caching makes repeated reads very fast
- **Large file processing**: Streaming and partial access optimization
- **Development workflows**: Seamless access to cloud data
- **Container environments**: No privileged access requirements

### When to consider alternatives

- **Write-intensive workloads**: Consider [Object Mount Fusion](./object-mount-fusion) for hybrid storage
- **Real-time applications**: Network latency may impact performance
- **Small random I/O**: Traditional block storage may be more efficient

## Consistency model

Object Mount provides **NFS-equivalent consistency** guarantees:

- **Single client**: All operations are immediately consistent
- **Multiple clients**: Eventually consistent with configurable sync intervals
- **Metadata operations**: Cached with refresh policies
- **File locking**: Supported through object metadata

## Provider compatibility

Object Mount works with any S3-compatible storage, but performance varies:

**Fully tested providers**:
- Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
- Storj, Wasabi, MinIO, Oracle OCI
- NetApp StorageGRID, Dell ECS

**Community-validated providers**:
- IBM Cloud Object Storage, Backblaze B2
- DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2

**Performance considerations by provider**:
- **Latency**: Geographic proximity affects response times
- **API compatibility**: Some providers have S3 API variations
- **Throughput limits**: Provider-specific bandwidth constraints
- **Cost structure**: Different pricing for operations and bandwidth

## Security model

Object Mount maintains security through:

- **Credential isolation**: Applications never see object storage credentials
- **Access control**: Standard POSIX permissions enforced by Object Mount
- **Encryption**: Supports provider-side and client-side encryption
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations

## Use case suitability

**Excellent fit**:
- Media processing and editing workflows
- Data analysis and machine learning pipelines
- Development and testing environments
- Backup and archival applications

**Good fit with considerations**:
- Database workloads (consider Fusion for write-heavy scenarios)
- Web serving (cache configuration important)
- Collaborative editing (understand consistency implications)

**May not be suitable**:
- Hard real-time applications requiring guaranteed latency
- Applications requiring strict POSIX lock semantics
- Workloads with extremely high small-write frequencies

Understanding these fundamental concepts helps you make informed decisions about when and how to deploy Object Mount in your infrastructure.

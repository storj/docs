  description: Comprehensive guide to understanding Object Mount Fusion hybrid storage and when it provides advantages over standard Object Mount deployment.
---

Object Mount Fusion represents a hybrid storage architecture that combines local storage with object storage to optimize performance for specific use cases. Understanding when and how to deploy Fusion helps you achieve optimal performance for demanding applications.

## What is Object Mount Fusion

Object Mount Fusion creates a tiered storage system where frequently accessed data resides on fast local storage while less frequently accessed data automatically migrates to cost-effective object storage.

### Fusion Architecture Components

**Local Storage Tier (Hot):**
- High-performance local storage (NVMe SSD, RAM disk)
- Immediate access with no network latency
- Limited capacity, higher cost per GB
- Handles active working set and write operations

**Object Storage Tier (Cool):**
- Unlimited capacity object storage
- Cost-effective long-term storage
- Network latency for first access
- Handles archived and infrequently accessed data

**Intelligent Management Layer:**
- Automatic data movement between tiers
- Predictive caching based on access patterns
- Background synchronization with object storage
- Transparent operation for applications

## Core Benefits of Fusion

### Performance Advantages

## Use Case Analysis

### Excellent Fusion Candidates

#### Database Workloads

**Traditional Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):**
- Active tables and indexes on local storage
- Historical data automatically tiered to object storage
- Transaction logs written locally with async backup
- Query performance maintained for active dataset

**Analytics Databases:**
- Recent data partitions kept local for fast queries
- Historical partitions moved to object storage
- Automatic data lifecycle management
- Cost-effective retention of years of data

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- 70-90% of queries against recent data (excellent local cache hit rate)
- Clear temporal access patterns (recent data accessed more frequently)
- Large total dataset size (benefits from object storage economics)

#### Write-Intensive Applications

**Log Aggregation Systems:**
- All log writes go to local storage (no write latency)
- Background processing and compression
- Automatic archival to object storage
- Fast query access to recent logs

**Content Creation Workflows:**
- Active projects on local storage
- Completed projects moved to object storage
- Version history and backups in object storage
- Instant access to active work

**Application Development:**
- Source code and active branches on local storage
- Build artifacts and releases in object storage
- Historical versions automatically archived
- Fast build and test cycles

### Good Fusion Candidates (With Considerations)

#### Media Processing

**Video Editing:**
- Current project files on local storage
- Raw footage and proxies intelligently cached
- Rendered outputs uploaded to object storage
- Consider storage requirements vs. project timelines

**Photo Workflows:**
- Recent shoots on local storage for editing
- Processed images and RAW archives in object storage
- Catalog and preview data optimally distributed
- Balance local storage size with archive needs

#### Scientific Computing

**Data Analysis Pipelines:**
- Current datasets and intermediate results local
- Source data and final results in object storage
- Model training data intelligently cached
- Consider data access patterns and processing requirements

### Poor Fusion Candidates

#### Streaming Applications

**Real-time Video Streaming:**
- Consistent network bandwidth requirements
- No benefit from local caching for live streams
- Standard Object Mount often sufficient
- Consider CDN integration instead

#### Archive-Only Workloads

**Backup Systems:**
- Data accessed infrequently after initial backup
- No benefit from local storage tier
- Standard Object Mount provides cost-effective solution
- Focus on bandwidth optimization instead

#### Small Working Sets

**Simple Web Applications:**
- Total data smaller than cost-effective local storage
- Access patterns don't benefit from tiering
- Complexity not justified by performance gains
- Standard Object Mount simpler and adequate

## Technical Requirements and Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Local Storage Specifications:**
- **Capacity**: 10-50% of total dataset (application dependent)
- **Performance**: NVMe SSD recommended for database workloads
- **Reliability**: RAID or replication for critical applications
- **Monitoring**: Capacity and performance tracking essential

**Network Requirements:**
- **Bandwidth**: Sufficient for background sync operations
- **Reliability**: Handle temporary connectivity issues gracefully
- **Latency**: Lower latency improves background sync efficiency

**System Resources:**
- **Memory**: Additional RAM for cache management and metadata
- **CPU**: Processing overhead for tiering decisions and data movement
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection

### Configuration Considerations

**Tiering Policies:**
- **Age-based tiering**: Move data to object storage after time threshold
- **Access-based tiering**: Move data based on access frequency
- **Size-based tiering**: Prioritize smaller files for local storage
- **Manual policies**: Application-specific tiering rules

**Sync Strategies:**
- **Aggressive sync**: Immediate upload to object storage (higher reliability)
- **Lazy sync**: Batch uploads during low-activity periods (higher performance)
- **Selective sync**: Only sync specific file types or directories
- **Bandwidth limiting**: Throttle sync to preserve application bandwidth

## Performance Expectations

### Fusion vs. Standard Object Mount

**Write Performance:**
- **Fusion**: Near-local performance for all writes
- **Standard**: Network-limited with write-behind caching
- **Improvement**: 5-50x better write latency, sustained throughput

**Read Performance (Hot Data):**
- **Fusion**: Local storage speed for cached data
- **Standard**: Object storage speed for all data
- **Improvement**: 10-1000x better latency for frequently accessed data

**Read Performance (Cold Data):**
- **Fusion**: Object storage speed plus tiering overhead
- **Standard**: Object storage speed
- **Difference**: Minimal performance difference, slight overhead

### Performance Tuning

**Cache Size Optimization:**
```bash
# Working set analysis
find /mount/point -type f -atime -7 | du -ch  # Files accessed in last week
find /mount/point -type f -atime -30 | du -ch # Files accessed in last month

# Recommended cache sizes
Database workloads: 20-40% of active dataset
Development: 50-80% of project files  
Media editing: 30-60% of current projects
Analytics: 15-30% of recent data
```

**Tiering Policy Tuning:**
- Monitor access patterns to optimize age-based policies
- Track cache hit rates to validate sizing decisions
- Adjust sync frequency based on reliability requirements
- Balance local storage utilization with performance needs

## Implementation Strategies

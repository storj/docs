Object Mount is a scalable, high-performance POSIX compatibility layer that lets you interact with files stored on object storage such as Storj, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or any S3-compatible object store hosted in the cloud or locally.

Once set up, you’ll be able to operate on your objects as if they are files with your existing tools and applications.

This guide contains step-by-step instructions for:

- Installing Object Mount
- Setting up access to your object storage
- Using Object Mount

This getting started guide assumes you already have an object storage system set up and is intended to get you set up and using Object Mount quickly. 
The <full user guide> contains additional details including alternative installation methods, a full list of available configuration options and additional use-cases and examples.

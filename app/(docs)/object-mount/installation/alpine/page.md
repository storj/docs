---

1. Download the installer. By downloading you are agreeing to the terms of the [End User License Agreement](https://www.storj.io/legal/terms-of-use). Click to download the latest version of the [self-extracting package for Alpine](https://github.com/cunoFS/cunoFS/releases/latest/download/cuno_x86_64_musl_apk.run) from your browser, or run the command:

   ```console
   wget https://github.com/cunoFS/cunoFS/releases/latest/download/cuno_x86_64_musl_apk.run
   ```

2. Download the public key for package verification `cunoFS.rsa.pub`:

   ```console
   wget https://github.com/cunoFS/cunoFS/releases/latest/download/cunoFS.rsa.pub
   ```

   or create a file called `cunoFS.rsa.pub` with our public key using this "one-liner" (copy the whole thing, paste into your terminal, hit enter/return):

   ```console
   cat >cunoFS.rsa.pub <<EOF
   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

   ```

3. Move the rsa public key into the Alpine directory of trusted signatures `/etc/apk/keys` (may need `sudo`):

   ```console
   mv cunoFS.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
   ```

4. Unpack the archive by running:

   ```console
   sh cuno_x86_64_musl_apk.run
   ```

5. Please follow the interactive steps, read the displayed end-user licence agreement ([EULA](https://www.storj.io/legal/terms-of-use)) and agree to the terms to continue with the extraction. To automate this, you can set the environment variable `CUNO_INSTALL_ACCEPT_EULA="yes"` (this is equivalent to accepting the EULA).

6. The archive and its contents will be unpacked into a directory named `cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_x86_64_musl` containing the package itself and additional documents:

   ```console
   $ ls cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_x86_64_musl
   cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_x84_64_.apk
   CUNO-Installation-and-User-Guide.pdf
   ```

7. Install Object Mount and its dependencies using `apk` (may need `sudo`):

   ```console
   apk add ./cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_x86_64_musl/cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_x86_64_musl.apk
   ```

8. The installation will prompt you to activate Object Mount by starting a trial or entering a license key. Follow the steps interactively, or automate this step by setting the environment variable `CUNO_INSTALL_LICENSE` to one of `trial | none | <your license key> | <full path to your license key file>`.

9. The installation will prompt you to set the `CUNO_ROOT` environment variable to the installation directory. This is not always necessary when using Object Mount, but it will make it easier to follow the steps in this guide.

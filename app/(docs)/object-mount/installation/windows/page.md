    Windows Installation Instructions

---


Windows clients require Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2): [Install WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or inside a Linux virtual machine.

WSL installs Ubuntu by default, so the installation instructions for Debian can then be followed. You will be able to use Object Mount with any Linux applications also installed in the Linux subsystem.

We are not offering further instructions at this stage.

    Windows Installation Instructions

---

A fully native Windows client is in private beta, with a public beta available soon!

However, if you would like to install the Linux version of Object Mount on Windows, you can leverage Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2): [Install WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or inside a Linux virtual machine.

WSL installs Ubuntu by default, so the installation instructions for [Debian](../debian) can then be followed. You will be able to use Object Mount with any Linux applications also installed in the Linux subsystem.

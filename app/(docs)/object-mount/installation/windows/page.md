Windows clients require Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2): [Install WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or inside a Linux virtual machine.

WSL installs Ubuntu by default, so the installation instructions for Debian can then be followed. You will be able to use cunoFS with any Linux applications also installed in the Linux subsystem.

% We are not offering further instructions at this stage.

% To expose cunoFS running within WSL to native Windows apps, follow the `Accessing Object Storage from Windows Apps`_.

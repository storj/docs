## macOS using Docker

{% callout type="note"  %}
Alternatives to Docker on Mac are available, some recommended alternatives are:

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (free) - If you're on Apple Silicon, enable Rosetta (Settings > Virtual Machine > VZ: Enable Rosetta support) and VirtioFS (Settings > Virtual Machine > Volumes: virtiofs)
- [OrbStack for Mac](https://orbstack.dev/) (may be faster) - OrbStack works out of the box.

Unfortunately, [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) is not currently supported.

## Additional instructions for cuno-mac users

If you have installed Object Mount directly onto a Mac, you will only have access to Object Mount functionality within Docker containers. We provide the `cuno-mac` utility which you run from Terminal to launch conveniently set-up Linux containers.

The first time `cuno-mac` is run, a Docker image will be created with Object Mount ready to use, and a user will be set up within the container similar to your local user on the host Mac.

The Dockerfile found at `~/.local/opt/cuno/share/macos/Dockerfile` can be edited to include any software packages you wish to have available inside the container. However, to update this will require deleting the old image first (by doing `docker rmi cuno-mac`), you can then run `cuno-mac` to rebuild it.

You must choose between using `cuno-mac` and `cuno` depending on the environment you are currently in.

To start a new session in which you can use Object Mount, you run `cuno-mac` in Terminal.

If any arguments are given to `cuno-mac`, it will start a temporary container and pass the arguments on to `cuno`.

If no arguments are given, `cuno-mac` will start a new interactive container and prefix `(cuno)` to your command-line prompt. This indicated that you are now inside a Docker container, so from here you cannot use `cuno-mac` and should instead use `cuno`.

To return to macOS, run `exit` until the `(cuno)` prefix is removed. You may only need to do this once, or you may need to do it multiple times if you have started subshells.

## Windows using WSL2

See [Windows](../installation/windows)

{% callout type="note"  %}
Refer to the [Microsoft documentation on installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install) for more information.
{% /callout %}

## Exposing mounted object storage to the Host OS

If you’re running Object Mount in a virtual machine, you can expose any object storage mounted as volumes in it using guest-to-host volume mapping.









## MacOS - Using Linux Containers

A fully native Mac client is in private beta, with a public beta available soon!

However, if you would like to run the Linux version of Object Mount on your Mac, you can do so inside a container.

{% callout type="note"  %}
For those on Apple Silicon (ARM) Macs, macOS 13.0 Ventura or later is required.
{% /callout %}

1. *All* Mac users require a virtualisation/containerisation software to be installed and set up.
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Intel" %}
## Intel
We fully support usage of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/). Docker is assumed in these guides.

Some settings should be changed to use Object Mount:
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Docker" %}
## Docker

We recommend changing the file sharing implementation to VirtioFS:
- Open Docker Desktop's ``Settings`` panel
- Open the ``General`` section.
- For the setting ``Choose file sharing implementation for your containers`` select ``VirtioFS``.
- Use the ``Apply & Restart`` button to save the change.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Rancher" %}
## Rancher

We recommend using the Apple Virtualization Framework (VZ), and the VirtioFS file sharing implementation:
- Open Rancher Desktop's ``Preferences`` panel.
- Open the ``Virtual Machine`` section.
- Open the ``Emulation`` tab, and set ``Virtual Machine Type`` to ``VZ``.
- Open ``Volumes`` tab, and set the ``Mount Type`` to  ``virtiofs``.
- Use the ``Apply`` button to save the changes.

In order to use the ``cuno-mac`` utility with Rancher, the "dockerd" (moby) container engine must be used:
- Open Rancher Desktop's ``Preferences`` panel.
- Open the ``Container Engine`` section.
- In the ``General`` tab, set the ``Container Engine`` to ``dockerd (moby)``.
- Use the ``Apply`` button to save the change.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="OrbStack" %}
## OrbStack

You may also use [OrbStack for Mac](https://orbstack.dev/)  and find it to be faster, but ``cuno-mac`` native support is not available in this case.

Unfortunately, [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) is not currently supported.
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}
{% /tab %}

{% tab label="Apple Silicon (ARM)" %}
## Apple Silicon (ARM)
We assume usage of Docker in these guides, but any of following containerisation technologies is supported with some additional set up required for ARM Macs:
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Docker" %}
## Docker

[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) version ``4.16.0`` or later is required.

Use Rosetta for hardware emulation:
- Open Docker Desktop's ``Settings`` panel
- Open the ``Features in development`` section.
- Open the ``Beta features`` tab, and enable the setting :code:`Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon`.
- We recommend changing the file sharing implementation to VirtioFS:
- Open Docker Desktop's ``Settings`` panel
- Open the ``General`` section.
- For the setting ``Choose file sharing implementation for your containers`` select ``VirtioFS``.
- Use the ``Apply & Restart`` button to save the change.
- Restart the Docker Engine by clicking on the Docker icon in the menu bar and selecting :code:`Restart`.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Rancher" %}
## Rancher

Use Rosetta for emulation, and we recommend changing the file sharing implementation to VirtioFS:
- Open Rancher Desktop's ``Preferences`` panel.
- Open the ``Virtual Machine`` section.
- Open the ``Emulation`` tab
- Set ``Virtual Machine Type`` to ``VZ``.
- In the ``VZ`` suboption, enable ``Rosetta``.
- Open ``Volumes`` tab, and set the ``Mount Type`` to  ``virtiofs``.
- Use the ``Apply`` button to save the changes.
- In order to use the ``cuno-mac`` utility with Rancher, the "dockerd" (moby) container engine must be used:
- Open Rancher Desktop's ``Preferences`` panel.
- Open the ``Container Engine`` section.
- In the ``General`` tab, set the ``Container Engine`` to ``dockerd (moby)``.
- Use the ``Apply`` button to save the change.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="OrbStack" %}
## OrbStack

Usage of Object Mount on [OrbStack for Mac](https://orbstack.dev/) containers works without any additonal set up required. 

OrbStack does not currently work with the  native/host ``cuno-mac`` utility.

2. Download the installer. By downloading you are agreeing to the terms of the 🌐 [End User License Agreement](https://www.storj.io/legal/terms-of-use). Click to download the 🌐 [Scripted Installer](https://github.com/cunoFS/cunoFS/releases/latest/download/cuno-glibc-installer.run).

3. Install the package onto your Mac directly, or inside a Linux container:
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Install on macOS" %}
## Install on macOS
Installing Object Mount on to your Mac directly will allow you to use ``cuno-mac``, our handy tool for launching Linux containers that automatically have your local installation of Object Mount installed inside them.

NB: To use ``cuno-mac``, you must also have Python 3 installed and available as ``python3`` in Terminal.

In a Terminal on your Mac, navigate to your download directory. If this was the default ``Downloads`` folder, you can run:
```shell
cd /Users/$USER/Downloads
```
Run the installer (without ``sudo``):
```shell
sh cuno-glibc-installer.run
```

Please follow the interactive steps, read the displayed end-user licence agreement (EULA) and agree to the terms to continue with the installation.
- Export the ``cuno-mac`` location to your ``PATH`` variable:
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/opt/cuno/share/macos
```
- To have this persist and apply to new Terminal sessions, add this as a new line at the bottom of the file ``/Users/<your username>/.bash_profile`` using a text editor, or using the following command in a Terminal session:
```shell 
echo "PATH=\$PATH:~/.local/opt/cuno/share/macos" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
**WARNING:** Do not miss the ``\`` because otherwise your current ``PATH`` will be written literally into the profile and break future changes.
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Install in Linux containers" %}
## Install in Linux containers
If installing on your Mac's local user is not preferred, you can install Object Mount within a container of your choice. 

We provide instructions here for installing within Docker containers using Ubuntu images. These instructions can be adapted to other Linux distributions, as well other virtualisation technologies such as Rancher, and OrbStack.

These instructions depend on the architecture of you Mac, please follow the appropriate guide:
{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Intel" %}
## Intel
- Run the following command to run a Docker container with the Object Mount installer made available at ``/tmp/cuno_install``:

**WARNING:** This command will download the latest stable Ubuntu image, which could be large.
```shell
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash \
-v <path_to_installation_script>/cuno-glibc-installer:/tmp/cuno_install \
--name cuno-container \
ubuntu:latest
```
- Within the Docker container (using ``docker exec -it cuno-container /bin/bash``), install Object Mount:
```shell
sh /tmp/cuno_install
```
- Please follow the interactive steps, read the displayed end-user licence agreement (EULA) and agree to the terms to continue with the installation.
{% /tab%}
{% tab label="Apple Silicon (ARM)" %}
## Apple Silicon (ARM)
- Run the following command to run a Docker container with the Object Mount installer made available at ``/tmp/cuno_install``:

**WARNING:** This command will download the latest stable Ubuntu image, which could be large.
```shell
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash \
-v <path_to_installation_script>:/tmp/cuno_install \
--name cuno-container \
--platform linux/amd64 ubuntu:latest
```

NB: The :code:`--platform linux/amd64` flag is *required* to run Object Mount on Macs with Apple Silicon.

- Within the Docker container (using ``docker exec -it cuno-container /bin/bash``), install Object Mount:
```shell
sh /tmp/cuno_install
```
- Please follow the interactive steps, read the displayed end-user licence agreement (EULA) and agree to the terms to continue with the installation.

4. The installation will prompt you to set the `CUNO_ROOT` environment variable to the installation directory. This is not always necessary when using Object Mount, but it will make it easier to follow the steps in this guide.










## Validating Your Installation (MOVE TO MAC SECTION)

You should now be able to run Object Mount from the command line, which you can test out by running the following command:

{% tabs %}


{% tab label="Mac (Linux)" %}
   ```shell
   # terminal
   cuno-mac version
   ```
    Note:

    If you have installed Object Mount directly onto a Mac, you must choose between using ``cuno-mac`` and ``cuno`` depending on the environment you are currently in.

    If you're in a Mac Terminal session and have not run ``cuno-mac``, then you must replace ``cuno`` in any instructions with ``cuno-mac``.

    If you have already started a Object Mount container by calling ``cuno-mac``, you will see the ``(cuno)`` prefix on your command line so any instructions using ``cuno`` commands will work as-is.

    To return to macOS, run ``exit``.

    See [user-guide-cuno-mac](../installation/mac) for more information.
    
    If you have already started a ``cuno-mac`` session:
    
   ```shell
   # terminal
   cuno version
   ```

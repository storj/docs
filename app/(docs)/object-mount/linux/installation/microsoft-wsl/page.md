# Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation

Storj provides a full-featured, native version of [Object Mount for Windows](docId:TSMB5yXSc4FcqwXj).

You are **strongly encouraged** to use that native Windows version. 

However, if you would like to install the Linux version of Object Mount within your Windows environment, you can leverage 🌐 [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

Installation of Object Mount for Linux within a Linux virtual machine or container is also possible.


## Windows Subsystem for Linux

WSL installs Ubuntu by default. 

For Ubuntu, follow either the [glibc Scripted Installer](docId:ahWohd5eegh6eizi) instructions or the [Debian Package Installer](docId:aemie9zeiP9Nie2k) instructions.

Once completed, you will be able to use Object Mount with any Linux applications also installed within the Linux subsystem.

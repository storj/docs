# Linux Installation and Usage

This section contains everything you need to install and use **Object Mount** on Linux.

Whether you’re setting up for creative workflows, remote storage access, or team-based collaboration, these pages will walk you through installation, setup, and day-to-day use.

## OS Version Differences

Storj’s **Object Mount for Linux** retains much of its original look and feel from its **cunoFS** heritage.

You will encounter many `cunu`-related commands, settings, and custom variables through your configuration and daily use of Object Mount for Linux. 

This is in contrast to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) experience Object Mount presents to Windows and macOS.

Other OS differences include:

| **Feature** | **Object Mount for Linux** | **Object Mount for Windows & macOS** |

| CLI-based   | 100% | No CLI available
| GUI-based   | No GUI available | 100%
| POSIX Mode Features | Wide array of settings | Either `on` or `off`
| `cuno`-based commands, settings, and variable | Large quantity of options | Few options

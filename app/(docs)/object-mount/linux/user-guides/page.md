---

This section provides step-by-step guides for common Object Mount tasks on Linux. These practical guides help you achieve specific goals with clear instructions and troubleshooting tips.

## Prerequisites

Before following these guides, ensure you have:

- A Linux system (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 9+, RHEL 7+, CentOS 7+, or compatible)
- Administrative privileges for installation tasks
- Basic command-line familiarity
- Object storage credentials (S3-compatible) for the provider you plan to use

## Getting started

If this is your first time using Object Mount:

1. **Start here**: [Your first mount tutorial](../../../tutorials/your-first-mount) - Complete hands-on introduction
2. **Understand the concepts**: [Object Mount vs traditional filesystems](../../../concepts/object-mount-vs-filesystems)
3. **Choose your approach**: Review the guides below for your specific needs

## Installation guides

Choose the installation method that matches your environment:

- [Install on Ubuntu/Debian](../installation/debian) - Package installation for APT-based systems
- [Install on RHEL/CentOS](../installation/redhat) - Package installation for RPM-based systems  
- [Install generic Linux binary](../installation/glibc) - Universal installation method
- [Install in Alpine Linux](../installation/alpine) - Lightweight container-focused installation
- [Install on macOS](../../macos/installation) - Package installation for macOS systems
- [Install on Windows](../../windows/installation) - Package installation for Windows systems

## Configuration guides

Set up Object Mount for your specific object storage provider:

- [Configure credentials](./credentials) - Set up authentication for your object storage
- [Configure performance settings](./configuration) - Optimize for your workload
- [Set up advanced options](./extraopts) - Additional configuration parameters
- [Configure logging](./appendix) - Set up monitoring and debugging

## Usage guides

Learn how to use Object Mount effectively:

- [Basic operations](./basic) - Mount, unmount, and basic file operations
- [Advanced usage](./advanced) - Complex scenarios and optimization
- [Access patterns](./access) - Understanding performance characteristics
- [Troubleshooting common issues](./limitations) - Solve problems and understand limitations

## Deployment guides

Deploy Object Mount in different environments:

- [Container deployment](./k8s) - Use Object Mount in Docker and Kubernetes
- [Multi-user setup](./tips) - Configure for shared environments
- [Uninstall Object Mount](./uninstall) - Clean removal procedures

## Provider compatibility

Object Mount works with any S3-compatible storage provider. Performance and compatibility vary:

### Fully supported providers
These providers are regularly tested and validated:

- [Amazon Web Services S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - Full compatibility and optimal performance
- [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) - Complete S3 API support
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) - Use with S3 compatibility layer
- [Storj DCS](https://storj.io/) - Decentralized object storage with full compatibility
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage.html)
- [Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage](https://wasabi.com/) - High-performance S3-compatible storage
- [MinIO](https://min.io/) - Self-hosted S3-compatible storage
- [NetApp StorageGRID](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid/)
- [Dell ECS Object Storage](https://www.delltechnologies.com/storage/ecs/)

### Community-validated providers  
These providers work with Object Mount based on user reports:

- [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage)
- [Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage)
- [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/)
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/)
- [Scality](https://www.scality.com/)
- [DataDirect Networks (DDN) Storage](https://www.ddn.com)

### Configuration considerations by provider

**For best performance**:
- Configure appropriate endpoint URLs for your provider
- Set optimal chunk sizes and concurrent connection limits
- Use provider-specific regions or availability zones
- Consider provider bandwidth and operation limits

**Provider-specific tips**:
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Use S3 interoperability mode for best performance
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Configure hot/cool tier access appropriately  
- **Storj**: Benefits from higher concurrency settings due to distributed architecture
- **MinIO**: Optimal for on-premises and edge deployment scenarios

## Verification and troubleshooting

After setup, verify your configuration:

1. **Test connectivity**: Ensure Object Mount can access your storage
2. **Performance validation**: Run benchmarks for your workload
3. **Monitor resources**: Check memory and CPU usage patterns
4. **Review logs**: Examine Object Mount operation logs

Common issues and solutions:

- **Mount failures**: Check credentials, endpoints, and network connectivity
- **Performance issues**: Review cache settings and provider-specific optimizations  
- **Application compatibility**: Understand [limitations](./limitations) and workarounds
- **Resource usage**: Optimize [configuration](./configuration) for your environment

## Getting help

If you need assistance:

1. Check the specific guide for your use case above
2. Review [troubleshooting guides](./limitations) for common issues
3. Search the [community forum](https://forum.storj.io) for similar problems
4. Contact support with detailed configuration and error information

# 🖥️ macOS Native Installation Guide

This section covers how to install the app on macOS using the standard `.dmg` installer. The process is quick and straightforward, with just a couple of setup steps to ensure everything works smoothly on both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) machines.

## ✅ System Requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following:

- macOS 12.0 Monterey or later  
- At least 300MB of free disk space  
- Internet connection for cloud mount 
- **macFUSE 4.8.2 or later** must be installed (we’ll walk you through it)

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Download the Installer

Download the correct `.dmg` file for your system. 

> 💡 **Tip:** Choose the version that matches your chip architecture: x86 for Intel or arm64 for Apple Silicon).

If you're unsure which chip you have:
- Click the Apple  menu in the top left  
- Select **About This Mac**  
- Look for **Processor** (Intel) or **Chip** (Apple M1, M2, etc.)

## 🔐 Step 3: Install macFUSE (Required)

The app uses **macFUSE** to handle filesystem mounting. If you don’t have it already:

1. Download the latest version from the [macFUSE releases page](https://osxfuse.github.io/)  
2. Open the `.dmg` and run the installer  
3. You’ll likely be prompted to allow a System Extension in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**  
4. Click “Allow” and restart your Mac into Recovery Mode if prompted

> **Note:** You must allow macFUSE in System Settings, or the app won't be able to mount.

- You may be prompted to grant access to removable volumes or network locations — click **Allow**

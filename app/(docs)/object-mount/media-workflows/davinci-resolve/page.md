# Using Object Mount with DaVinci Resolve

This guide walks you through the best setup for using Object Mount with **DaVinci Resolve**, along with a few optional tweaks and performance tips that may help smooth things out depending on your system and workflow.


## Recommended Settings (Per Project)

After opening or importing your Resolve project, please check the following:

1. From the top menu bar, go to:
   **Preferences > System > Media Storage**

2. Add your **Object Mount** volume as a **Media Storage Location**:
   - The Object Mount volume **should not** be first in the list.
   - Resolve uses the _top location_ for gallery stills and cache files, so keep this separate.

3. Disable **Direct I/O** for the Object Mount path:
   - This helps ensure better compatibility and smoother read/write behavior.


## Optional Performance Tweaks

These settings aren’t required, but can improve responsiveness or playback performance &mdash; especially on larger projects or when working over cloud storage.

**Playback and Caching:**

  - **Playback > Render Cache** → Set to **Smart**
  - **Playback > Timeline Proxy Resolution** → Set to **Half** or **Quarter**
  - **Playback > Proxy Handling** → Set to **Prefer Proxies**
  - **Playback > Use Optimized Media if Available** → Enable

**Preview Panels and Navigation:**

  - In the **Edit** tab:
    - Use the **Timeline View Options** (top-left of the timeline)
      - Set **Thumbnail View** to **Thumbnail** or **None**
      - Disable **Display Audio Waveform**

  - In the **Media** tab:
    - Switch **Timelines panel** to **List View** (top right)
    - Open the overflow menu:
      - Disable **Film Strip**
      - Disable **Audio Waveforms**

  - In **Media Storage**, switching from **Thumbnail View** to **List View** can also help when browsing through folders on Object Mount volumes.


## Monitoring Performance

Because of how Object Mount optimizes transfers, the built-in file copy progress indicators (in Finder or File Explorer) may not accurately reflect what’s happening behind the scenes.

For a better view of performance:

  - On **macOS**: Open **Activity Monitor > Network tab**
  - On **Windows**: Go to **Task Manager > Performance > Network**

If Object Mount is saturating the network connection &mdash; that’s a good sign! It’s doing what it’s designed to do. 

Transfers may still appear idle in the UI, but they are active “under the hood”.

{% callout type="info" %}
  Don’t cancel a transfer just because the Finder or Explorer bar seems stuck &mdash; always check your system’s network usage first.
{% /callout %}

# Using Object Mount with Adobe Premiere Pro

Object Mount makes it easy to browse, import, and edit footage directly from S3-compatible storage in Adobe Premiere Pro. Whether you're working with local proxies, editing remotely, or centralising project media, Object Mount integrates smoothly into your editing pipeline.

---

## Recommended Setup

Once you've mounted your object storage with Object Mount, your volume will appear like a standard drive in **File Explorer (Windows)** or **Finder (macOS)**. From there, you can work as usual in Premiere Pro with just a few things to keep in mind.

### 1. Importing Footage

- Go to **File > Import**, or use the **Media Browser**
- Navigate to your **Object Mount** drive and select your files
- Footage can be previewed and scrubbed before importing

{% callout type="info" %}
If you notice slower performance with large files or over remote networks, consider using proxy workflows.
{% /callout %}

## Proxy and Cache Settings (Recommended)

While Object Mount enables direct-from-cloud editing, Premiere Pro still benefits from local cache for smooth playback and faster timeline scrubbing.

### Suggested settings:

- **File > Project Settings > Scratch Disks**  
  - Set **Media Cache** and **Previews** to a **fast local SSD**

- **Preferences > Media Cache**  
  - Enable **Auto delete cache files older than X days** to keep things tidy

- **Create Proxies** via **Ingest Settings** or manually using the **Project panel**  
  - Store proxies on a local drive
  - Set **Proxy File Format** to ProRes Proxy or H.264 Low Res for faster performance

- Enable **Toggle Proxies** in the Program Monitor to switch views on the fly

---

## Relinking Media
If a project was opened on a different machine or the mount point has changed:

- Go to **File > Link Media**
- Browse to your Object Mount volume
- Premiere will relink to all matching file paths automatically

{% callout type="info"}
Object Mount maintains consistent folder structures across platforms, which makes relinking straightforward.
{% /callout }

---

## Performance Tips

- Stick to **List View** in Media Browser when browsing large folders
- Use proxies for multicam or high-resolution editing (e.g. 4K, RAW)
- Avoid saving the Premiere project file directly to the Object Mount drive — store locally and backup to cloud separately if needed

---

## Storage Visibility

Your Object Mount volume will show up like this:
- On **macOS**: Under **Locations** in Finder
- On **Windows**: As a mapped drive under **This PC**

Once mounted, there’s no need to sync or copy files — you’re working live from the source.

---

## Reminder on Write Operations

Premiere Pro reads from cloud storage efficiently, but for best results:

- Keep render outputs, scratch files, and auto-saves on a local drive
- Use Object Mount for **read access to source footage**
- Export final renders locally, then upload back to your storage if needed

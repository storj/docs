Welcome to the Storj Object Mount Documentation!

Storj’s Object Mount makes working with object storage as fast and seamless as using a local drive.

Whether you’re working in media production, research & development, or backup workflows, Object Mount combines the convenience of local storage with the scalability of the cloud.


## What is Object Mount?

Object Mount is a high-performance mount client that provides seamless, native access to object storage as if it were a fast, local file system. It allows existing applications to interact with object storage content without needing to recode apps or change your workflow &mdash; just mount and go.

| **Feature** | **Benefit of Object Mount**   |
| :- | :- |
| **Native Clients** | Object Mount offers native clients for Linux, Windows and macOS. Installs in minutes and can run inside unmodified containers.|
| **Compatible and Seamless** | Run your same, unmodified tools and applications &mdash; now with fast access to object storage data. Files and directories on object storage behave the same as they do on a local disk. Fast, transparent, user-friendly.|
| **POSIX Compliant** | Run your Linux tools, applications and workloads as expected &mdash; with all the same user and group permissions, symbolic & hard links, etc. |
| **High Performance** | Intelligent caching and high-throughput make editing large files in real-time a breeze. Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve and any other industry standard toolkit all work “out-of-the-box.” Cloud storage is now just as responsive as local storage. |
| **No Proprietary Formatting** | Object Mount keeps your files in their original format without any proprietary conversions. Your data is accessible across workflows, teams, tools, apps and dashboards. No risk of vendor lock-in. |
| **Cost-efficient and Scalable** | By only accessing the bytes you need, Object Mount minimizes download bandwidth and reduces the need for expansive (and expensive) local storage arrays, lowering egress costs and saving you money on every project.|
| **Eco-friendly Collaboration** | Reduce the energy and resource footprint of your Media and Entertainment workflows. Global teams access the same ‘single source of truth’ content without moving, copying or replicating media across multiple, disparate platforms. |

Storj’s Object Mount makes working with object storage as smooth and seamless as using a local drive.

Whether you’re working in media production, research & development or backup workflows, Object Mount combines the convenience of local storage with the scalability of the cloud.


## What is Object Mount?

Object Mount is a high-performance mount client that provides seamless, native access to object storage as if it were a fast, local file system. It allows existing applications to interact with object storage data without needing to recode apps or change your workflow &mdash; just mount and go.

| **Feature** | **Benefit of Object Mount**   |
| :- | :- |
| **Native Clients** | Object Mount offers native clients for Linux, Windows and macOS. Install in minutes or run inside unmodified containers.|
| **Compatible and Seamless** | Run your same, unmodified tools and applications, but now with access to ultra-fast object storage. Files and directories on object storage behave the same as they do on a local disk. Super-fast, transparent and user-friendly.|
| **POSIX Compliant** | Run your Linux tools, applications and workloads as expected &mdash; with all the same user and group permissions, symbolic & hard links, etc. |
| **High Performance** | Intelligent caching and high-throughput make editing large files in real-time a breeze. Whether you’re working with Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve or any other industry standard software, Object Mount makes cloud storage as responsive as local storage. |
| **No Proprietary Formatting** | Object Mount keeps your files in their original format without any proprietary conversions. Your data is accessible across workflows, teams, tools and dashboards &mdash; without risk of vendor lock-in. |
| **Cost-efficient and Scalable** | By only accessing the bytes you need, Object Mount optimizes the use of cloud object storage use and minimizes download bandwidth, significantly reducing the need for local disk space, shrinking egress costs, and saving you money on every project.|
| **Eco-friendly Collaboration** | Reduce the energy and resource footprint of your Media and Entertainment workflows. Global teams access the same ‘single source of truth’ content without moving or copying media across multiple, disparate platforms. |

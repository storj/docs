There are multiple ways to install Object Mount:

- an installation script, which allows users to install Object Mount without root privileges [user guide](../user-guides/install/scripted-installer).
- standard packages for various Linux distributions [user-guide-package-manager-install](../user-guides/install#package-manager-installation).

## Install locations

When Object Mount is installed via the Scripted Installer, it gets installed to different locations depending on whether it was installed by root, or by a non-root user.
Hereafter, root installations are called 'system-wide', and non-root installations are called 'user-local'.

{% callout type="note"  %}
A package manager install of Object Mount is always system-wide, regardless of the privileges of the user installing it.
{% /callout %}


| Install type  | Location (:code:`CUNO_ROOT`) | Symlinks created in |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| User-local | `~/.local/opt/cuno/`| `~/.local/bin/`
|||`~/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`
|||`~/.local/share/man/`|
| System-wide| `/opt/cuno/` | `/usr/bin/` 
|||`/usr/lib/`
|||`/usr/share/man/`|


## Scripted installer

### Distros using glibc (most)

Most Linux distributions (including Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat and its derivatives) use the GNU Project's C standard library (glibc). This installer/version is compatible with all such Linux distributions.

See [glibc](../installation/glibc)

### Distros using musl (Alpine)

Some Linux distributions (Alpine) use the musl C standard library. This installer/version is compatible with all such Linux distributions.

See [musl](../installation/musl)


## Package manager installation


### Debian and derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu)

See [debian](../installation/debian)

### Red Hat and derivatives

See [Red Hat](../installation/redhat)

### Alpine Linux

{% callout type="warning"  %}
Object Mount APK packages for Alpine will be available soon.
{% /callout %}

```console
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted ./cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_amd64_musl/cuno_{FULL-VERSION}_amd64_musl.apk
```

## Other operating systems

Object Mount is built for Linux distributions only, and does not {emphasis}`natively` support other operating systems.
However, there are still ways to use Object Mount.

### macOS using Docker

{% callout type="note"  %}
Alternatives to Docker on Mac are available, some recommended alternatives are:

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (free) - If you're on Apple Silicon, enable Rosetta (Settings > Virtual Machine > VZ: Enable Rosetta support) and VirtioFS (Settings > Virtual Machine > Volumes: virtiofs)
- [OrbStack for Mac](https://orbstack.dev/) (may be faster) - OrbStack works out of the box.

Unfortunately, [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) is not currently supported.

### Additional instructions for cuno-mac users

If you have installed Object Mount directly onto a Mac, you will only have access to Object Mount functionality within Docker containers. We provide the `cuno-mac` utility which you run from Terminal to launch conveniently set-up Linux containers.

The first time `cuno-mac` is run, a Docker image will be created with Object Mount ready to use, and a user will be set up within the container similar to your local user on the host Mac.

The Dockerfile found at `~/.local/opt/cuno/share/macos/Dockerfile` can be edited to include any software packages you wish to have available inside the container. However, to update this will require deleting the old image first (by doing `docker rmi cuno-mac`), you can then run `cuno-mac` to rebuild it.

You must choose between using `cuno-mac` and `cuno` depending on the environment you are currently in.

To start a new session in which you can use Object Mount, you run `cuno-mac` in Terminal.

If any arguments are given to `cuno-mac`, it will start a temporary container and pass the arguments on to `cuno`.

If no arguments are given, `cuno-mac` will start a new interactive container and prefix `(cuno)` to your command-line prompt. This indicated that you are now inside a Docker container, so from here you cannot use `cuno-mac` and should instead use `cuno`.

To return to macOS, run `exit` until the `(cuno)` prefix is removed. You may only need to do this once, or you may need to do it multiple times if you have started subshells.

### Windows using WSL2

See [Windows](../installation/windows)

{% callout type="note"  %}
Refer to the [Microsoft documentation on installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install) for more information.
{% /callout %}

### Exposing mounted object storage to the Host OS

If youâ€™re running Object Mount in a virtual machine, you can expose any object storage mounted as volumes in it using guest-to-host volume mapping.

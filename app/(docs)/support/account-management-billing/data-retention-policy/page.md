  title: Understanding the Storj Data Retention Policy
  description:
    In-depth overview on Storj's policy on data retention tied to account
    payment and usage limits.
---

All unpaid balances must be paid via a valid payment method in a billing cycle. Note that if no valid payment method remains on an account, usage limits may be reduced to zero. If all credit cards expire or are invalid, or the STORJ token balance is exhausted and no new payment method is added on a project, after a reasonable time and opportunity to add a payment method, we reserve the right to reclaim the available resources (the storage space and bandwidth made available by Storage Node Operators to the Storj network) and delete the data from Storj if a valid payment method is not added and any unpaid fees are not paid.

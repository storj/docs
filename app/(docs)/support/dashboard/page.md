  title: Understanding the Storj Console Project Dashboard
  description:
    An overview of Storj's Console Project Dashboard and details on its navigational
    elements, storage and bandwidth usage, project details, and bucket information.

The landing page for the Storj Satellite Admin Console is the Project Dashboard.

When you log into the Satellite Admin Console, you start on the Project Dashboard for your default Project. A Project is the basic unit for aggregating usage, calculating billing, invoicing fees, collecting payment, and handling access management. Users can create multiple Projects and projects are invoiced separately. Within a Project, usage is tracked at the Bucket level and aggregated for invoicing to the Project. Project names are not client-side encrypted so that they may be rendered in the Satellite user interface. There are two main drivers for creating multiple Projects: access management and billing.

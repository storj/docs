Token sale participants received a link with the smart contract address and details about when and how they would be able to release the STORJ tokens they purchased from the lockup contract. At this time, all tokens that were locked in a token sale smart contract have passed the expiration date, so if you still have not released your tokens yet, you may do so at your convenience, using the instructions that were mailed to you before.

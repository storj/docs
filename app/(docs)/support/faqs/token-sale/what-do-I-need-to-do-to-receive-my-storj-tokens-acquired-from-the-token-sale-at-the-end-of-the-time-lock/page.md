You will need to broadcast a transaction at the end of the time lock. That transaction will tell the time vault smart contract to send your tokens to your pre-registered receiving address. If you purchased tokens with a lockup contract, an email with exact instructions how and when to release the tokens was sent to you already. As of today, all time lock contracts already have passed their expiration date, so you may use the instructions you received in the email to release your tokens at your convenience now.

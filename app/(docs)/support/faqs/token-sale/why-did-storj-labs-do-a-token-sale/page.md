Token Sales have gained significant momentum because of their ability to support distributed applications and open source development teams. Revenue generated from the Storj Token Sale allows us to accelerate product development, while promoting developer adoption and network growth. Additionally, it allows us to finance the continued development of Storj and create a fully functional distributed, decentralized cloud storage platform.

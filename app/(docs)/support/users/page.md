## Introduction

Collaborate with other developers and give them access to work with your project.

If you need to collaborate with other developers on a project, you can add other developers who have an account on the same Satellite as your project.

{% callout type="warning"  %}
When you add another user to your project, that user will have full access to the Project Dashboard, Object Browser, and access Grants for your Project.
{% /callout %}

Navigate to the **Team** screen.

Select the **Add Member** button

Type in the email addresses that the users have registered with their Satellite Accounts. The Users will be added to the Project Team and notified via email.

**Technical Preview Service Release**

S3 Compatible Object Lock is in early development with restricted availability to invited customers for the purpose of testing or validating compatibility. Please refer to our [Terms of Service](https://www.storj.io/legal/terms-of-service) for more information on release definitions.

## Summary

### Overview
Storj is currently developing S3 Compatible Object Lock. As part of that development, we have an early Technical Preview Service Release that can be used to test compatibility. Note that any testing will not be representative of real-world performance, and there is no value in testing anything outside the correctness of the implementation.

### FAQ
- **When will Object Lock be in Beta? When will it be fully released?**
	- We expect to begin an open beta of Object Lock in Q3 of calendar year 2024.
	- We tentatively plan to add Governance Mode and Legal Hold to the beta in Q3 of calendar year 2024, with the goal of rolling out Object Lock fully by the end of calendar year 2024.
- **Why would I test this Technical Preview?**
	- We used this particular Technical Preview to do our own validation against key tools that implement S3's Object Lock, for example, Veeam.
	- If your product or an integration uses Object Lock, you can use this Technical Preview to validate compatibility before we get into Beta.
- **How do I test the Technical Preview?**
    - We are only opening testing to select customers and partners. Feel free to indicate your interest in the upcoming beta by filling out the form below.
- **How do I sign up to join the Beta when it arrives?**
	- Fill out this form to be the first to know when the beta is arriving: [Sign Up Form](https://forms.gle/dkyqXjMkwQ34o7os6)
- **Why doesn't the initial version support Governance Mode and Legal Hold?**
	- Our initial goal is to implement the most common S3 features regarding immutability and deliver them as quickly as possible, which led us to focus on the strictest form of object lock: Compliance Mode.
- **How do I give feedback or request features related to Object Lock?**
	- Our roadmap is public. Here are the relevant roadmap items:
		- [S3 Object Lock: Compliance Mode](https://github.com/storj/roadmap/issues/47)
		- [S3 Object Lock: Add Governance Mode and Legal Hold](https://github.com/storj/roadmap/issues/98)

### New S3 Actions Supported:
| Action                     | API Description                                            | Description of Change(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GetObjectLockConfiguration | Gets the object lock configuration for a bucket.           | Will return the ObjectLockConfiguration with `ObjectLockEnabled` either as `Enabled` or empty. `Rule` will not be included as a response element as specifying a bucket-level object Lock rule is initially out of scope. |
| PutObjectRetention         | Places an object retention configuration on an object.<br> | The only value supported for `Mode` is `COMPLIANCE` as Governance Mode is initially out of scope.                                                                                                                         |
| GetObjectRetention         | Retrieves an object's retention settings.                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In addition to the new and updated actions supported above, we have a follow on roadmap item to implement the remaining scope of S3 Compatible Lock, mainly the addition of Governance Mode and Legal hold. These additional actions are outlined in the roadmap item here: https://github.com/storj/roadmap/issues/98

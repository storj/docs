## What are custom domains?

The custom domains feature allows users to use their own domain name to access the content they have stored using Storj. Instead of using the default URL provided by linksharing, users can access their content using a custom domain that they have set up.

### Key Benefits

**Memorable**: A custom domain is easier to remember than a generic linksharing domain. This makes it more likely that users will return to the content in the future.

**Consistent**: Using a custom domain for all of a user's shared content helps to establish a consistent brand image and makes it easier for users to recognize the source of the content.

**Secure**: The use of a custom domain over HTTPS (as opposed to HTTP) can significantly improve security. This allows users to ensure that their links are coming from a trusted source, and protects user data and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, this feature represents a major improvement over the existing Linksharing service, which only allowed for custom domains over HTTP without additional configuration and addition of third party products.

# Step-by-Step Instructions

## Prerequisites

{% callout type="info"  %}
A Pro Account is required if you want the custom domain to be served via HTTPS
{% /callout %}

1.  A Storj account: **[https://www.storj.io/signup](https://www.storj.io/signup)**.

2.  The Uplink CLI tool installed on your local machine: **[](docId:TbMdOGCAXNWyPpQmH6EOq)**

3.  A custom domain registered with a domain name registrar.

4.  Access to the DNS records for the custom domain.

## Instructions

###

For this step you will execute `uplink share` for the bucket or object prefix (not individual objects) that you want to share (this will be the root for your custom domain).

The following placeholders should be replaced in the sample code provided below:

- **_\<hostname>_**: This is your custom subdomain (sub.domain.com)
- **_\<bucket>_**: The bucket you want to share
- **_\<prefix>_** (optional): The path to the specific folder you want to share (this is known as a prefix)

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="Windows" %}

```powershell
./uplink.exe share --dns <hostname> sj://<bucket>/<prefix>
```

{% /tab %}

{% tab label="Linux" %}

```shell
uplink share --dns <hostname> sj://<bucket>/<prefix>
```

{% /tab %}

{% tab label="macOS" %}

```shell
uplink share --dns <hostname> sj://<bucket>/<prefix>
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

Anything shared with `--dns` will be _readonly_ and available _publicly_ (no secret key needed).

For securing your domain with TLS you can add the `--tls` flag, which returns an additional TXT record to secure your domain (Pro Accounts only).

The command above prints a zone file with the information needed to create 3 DNS records (4 if `--tls` was used). Your CNAME should match the linkshare service domain (`link.storjshare.io` by default).

```shell
$ORIGIN example.com.
$TTL    3600
<hostname>    	IN	CNAME	link.storjshare.io.
txt-<hostname> 	IN	TXT  	storj-root:<bucket>/<prefix>
txt-<hostname> 	IN	TXT  	storj-access:<access key>
txt-<hostname> 	IN	TXT  	storj-tls:true
```

## Setting up a custom domain

1\. Purchase a domain name from a domain name registrar.

2\. Configure your DNS records to include the following

- Create a CNAME record on your hostname using the CNAME from your generated zone file as the target name.

- Create two TXT records, prepending `txt-` to your hostname. The value of each of these should also be in the generated file above:

  - `storj-root:<bucket>/<prefix>`

  - `storj-access:<access key id>`

Your final set of DNS entries should look like the following:

| Type  | Name                 | Content                              |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| CNAME | www\.example.com     | link.storjshare.io.                  |
| TXT   | txt-www\.example.com | storj-root:**_\<bucket>/\<prefix>_** |
| TXT   | txt-www\.example.com | storj-access:**_\<access key id>_**  |

To enable HTTPS for your custom domain (Pro Accounts Only) create one last TXT record:

| Type | Name                 | Content         |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| TXT  | txt-www\.example.com | storj-tls\:true |

3\. You should now be able to access your content using your custom domain! DNS propagation usually takes less than a few hours, but can take up to 48 hours in some cases.

## Considerations if setting up DNS with a CDN like Cloudflare

### When HTTPS is enabled for custom domains (Pro Accounts Only)

Cloudflare will default to [proxying DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/get-started-free/onboarding/proxy-dns-records/).

Proxying must be disabled for the `CNAME` record, if you've added the `storj-tls:true` TXT record. If enabled, Cloudflare will terminate TLS and hinder the ability of the linksharing service to procure and renew TLS certificates for your custom domain.

Disabling the proxy will mean the requests are sent directly to the linksharing service which will provide an end-to-end encryption from the user to the service.

### Using Cloudflare as a proxy

If you still want to use Cloudflare as the proxy for your custom domain and use HTTPS, these steps should be followed:

* Ensure the `storj-tls:true` DNS TXT record is removed.
* Change the [TLS encryption mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes) to "Flexible".
* Enable [Always Use HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https).

This is helpful if you require HTTPS, but don't have a Pro Account yet. Cloudflare will be managing the TLS certificate and provide HTTPS for your custom domain.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I set up a custom domain for my linksharing?

To set up a custom domain, you need to create several DNS entries in your domain's DNS configuration, such as a CNAME record that points to the linksharing service domain, a TXT record that contains the root of your file share (either a bucket or prefix), and a TXT record that contains your access key. Please refer to the steps above for more details.

### What are the requirements for using a custom domain with linksharing?

To use a custom domain with linksharing, you must have a valid domain name, access to its DNS configuration, and the ability to create and manage DNS records.

### Why is my browser telling me that my connection is not secure?

While Linksharing links are secure, when you use a custom domain the browser is expecting a TLS certificate for your domain to be present on the Storj servers hosting the link. We do not have this certificate by default, so you will need to upgrade to a [](docId:Zrbz4XYhIOm99hhRShWHg) and follow the relevant steps above to enable TLS (HTTPS) in the browser.

### Why am I seeing an "Invalid SSL certificate" error from Cloudflare?

Problem: Customers using Cloudflare (or likely anything as a reverse proxy) who have certain TLS settings may see an error. In an effort to improve security and bring users SSL certs without the need for a CDN proxy, we no longer support self-signed certificates for custom domains.

### How do I verify my custom domain?

Verifying your custom domain with linksharing involves adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS configuration that contains a unique string or value provided by the service. The service then checks for the presence of this value in your domain's DNS records to confirm that you have control over the domain.

### How do I troubleshoot issues with my custom domain setup?

If you are having trouble setting up your custom domain, common solutions include:

- Ensuring that your domain name registration is valid and not expired

- Checking your DNS configuration for typos or misconfigurations

- Waiting for DNS changes to propagate

- Contacting your domain provider

- Asking or searching in the [Storj community forum](https://forum.storj.io/)

### Can I use a custom domain for multiple file sharing buckets?

Yes, you can use a custom domain for multiple file sharing buckets or prefixes by creating separate CNAME, TXT, and access key records for each bucket and associating them with a unique subdomain or path.

### How do I update my custom domain after it has been set up?

Updating your custom domain typically involves making changes to your domain's DNS configuration, such as updating the values of existing records or adding new records. It is important to ensure that any changes are properly propagated and tested before relying on the updated configuration.

### What happens to my existing links when I switch to a custom domain?

Existing and new links that use the default domain name provided by linksharing will continue to work in addition to your custom domain.

### What's the difference between HTTPS and TLS?

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol for secure communication over the internet, while TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating computer applications. TLS is the successor to SSL and is the standard protocol used to secure HTTPS.

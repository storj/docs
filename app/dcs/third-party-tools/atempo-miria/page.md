## Advantages of Miria with Storj

The combination of Miria and Storj provides complete flexibility for cloud management at a competitive cost. Miria handles data archiving and organization from primary storage to the Storj cloud S3 infrastructure; large data sets can be hosted, stored, replicated, and recovered at any time through Storj's platform.

Security integrations in Miria ensure that data on Storj is kept safe, while metadata archives allow large datasets to be easily accessible and manageable. Manual and automatic archiving capabilities in Miria simplify access and economize storage costs. Miria meets any requirements: data volumes, different file sizes and formats, storage technologies, and workflows.

## Integration

Miria integrates with Storj cloud storage through the S3 protocol. The Miria server orchestrates the Miria data movers, which integrates with Storj through the S3 protocol. Conversely, any other storage platform also integrates with the data movers, thus integrating data movement and management from heterogeneous sources. The Miria solution is fully scalable - simply add another Miria Data mover as needed.

To integrate Miria with Storj, you must create S3 credentials for Miria in Storj and pass them to the Miria server through the Miria web interface.

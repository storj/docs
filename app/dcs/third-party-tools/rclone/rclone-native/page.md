  description:
    Guide on how to natively configure Rclone with Storj for optimal download
    performance and client-side encryption. Explains the setup process including configuration
    and authentication.
---

## Selecting an Integration Pattern

Use our native integration pattern to take advantage of client-side encryption as well as to achieve the best possible download performance. Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1GB upload will result in 2.68GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.

## Use this pattern for

- The strongest security
- The best download speeds

## Setup

First, [Download](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and extract the rclone binary onto your system.

Execute the config command:

```bash
rclone config
```

A text-based menu will prompt. Type `n` and hit `Enter` to create a new remote configuration.

```Text
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> n
```

Enter a name for the new remote configuration, e.g., `waterbear`.

```Text
name> waterbear
Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
```

A long list of supported storage backends will prompt. Enter `storj` and hit `Enter`.

```Text
Option Storage.
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value.
...
41 / Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage
   \ (storj)
...
Storage> storj
```

Choose your authentication method: existing access grant or new access grant from [](docId:OXSINcFRuVMBacPvswwNU) (access token).

```Text
Storage> storj
Option provider.
Choose an authentication method.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own string value.
Press Enter for the default (existing).
 1 / Use an existing access grant.
   \ (existing)
 2 / Create a new access grant from satellite address, API key, and passphrase.
   \ (new)
provider>
```

If you selected to authenticate with an existing access grant, enter the serialized access grant you have received by someone else.

```Text
provider> 1
Option access_grant.
Access grant.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
access_grant> 1cC...
--------------------
[waterbear]
type = storj
access_grant = 1cC...
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

If you selected to authenticate with a new access grant, first enter the satellite address by selecting one from the list or enter the address of a 3rd-party satellite.

```Text
provider> 2
Option satellite_address.
Satellite address.
Custom satellite address should match the format: `<nodeid>@<address>:<port>`.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own string value.
Press Enter for the default (us-central-1.storj.io).
 1 / US Central 1
   \ (us-central-1.storj.io)
 2 / Europe West 1
   \ (europe-west-1.storj.io)
 3 / Asia East 1
   \ (asia-east-1.storj.io)
satellite_address>
```

{% callout type="info"  %}
If you enter a 3rd-party satellite, the address must also include the node ID of the satellite. This is required to establish a secure connection with the satellite.
{% /callout %}

The second step of creating a new access grant is to enter your generated [](docId:OXSINcFRuVMBacPvswwNU).

```Text
Option api_key.
API key.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
api_key> 1Cjfjf...
```

The final step of creating a new access grant is to enter your encryption passphrase.

```Text
Option passphrase.
Encryption passphrase.
To access existing objects enter passphrase used for uploading.
Enter a value. Press Enter to leave empty.
passphrase> your-secret-encryption-phrase
```

{% callout type="info"  %}
The passphrase is used for encrypting and decrypting the data stored on Storj (formerly known as Tardigrade). If you have any data previously uploaded to this project, you must enter the same passphrase in order to download it successfully.
{% /callout %}

A summary of the remote configuration will prompt. Type `y`and hit `Enter` to confirm it.

```Text
[waterbear]
type = storj
satellite_address = 121RTSDpyNZVcEU84Ticf2L1ntiuUimbWgfATz21tuvgk3vzoA6@asia-east-1.tardigrade.io:7777
api_key = 1Cjfjf...
passphrase = your-secret-encryption-phrase
access_grant = 1E1F...
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Now you should see one remote configuration available. Enter `q` and hit `Enter` to quit the configuration wizard.

```Text
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
waterbear            storj

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

{% callout type="info"  %}
Follow the [Getting Started guide](docId:AsyYcUJFbO1JI8-Tu8tW3) to setup Rclone.
{% /callout %}

The follow are additional commands or options you can consider when using Rclone

## Configuration password

For additional security, you should consider using the `s) Set configuration password` option. It will encrypt the `rclone.conf` configuration file. This way secrets like the [](docId:OXSINcFRuVMBacPvswwNU), the encryption passphrase, and the access grant can't be easily stolen.

## Create a Bucket

Use the `mkdir` command to create new bucket, e.g., `mybucket`.

```yaml
rclone mkdir waterbear:mybucket
```

## List All Buckets

Use the `lsf` command to list all buckets.

{% callout type="info"  %}
Note the colon (`:`) character at the end of the command line.
{% /callout %}

```bash
rclone lsf waterbear:
```

## Delete a Bucket

Use the `rmdir` command to delete an empty bucket.

```bash
rclone rmdir waterbear:mybucket
```

Use the `purge` command to delete a non-empty bucket with all its content.

```bash
rclone purge waterbear:mybucket
```

## Upload Objects

Use the `copy` command to upload an object.

```bash
rclone copy --progress ~/Videos/myvideo.mp4 waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

{% callout type="info"  %}
The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information. Remove it if you don't need this information.
{% /callout %}

Use a folder in the local path to upload all its objects.

```bash
rclone copy --progress ~/Videos/ waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

{% callout type="info"  %}
Only modified files will be copied.
{% /callout %}

## List Objects

Use the `ls` command to list recursively all objects in a bucket.

```bash
rclone ls waterbear:mybucket
```

Add the folder to the remote path to list recursively all objects in this folder.

```bash
rclone ls waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

Use the `lsf` command to list non-recursively all objects in a bucket or a folder.

```bash
rclone lsf waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

## Download Objects

Use the `copy` command to download an object.

{% callout type="info"  %}
The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="info"  %}
Using `--disable-http2` with rclone for Storj is recommended for increased transfer speeds by avoiding HTTP/2 specific issues.
{% /callout %}

```bash
rclone copy --disable-http2 --progress waterbear:mybucket/videos/myvideo.mp4 ~/Downloads/
```

Use a folder in the remote path to download all its objects.

```bash
rclone copy --progress waterbear:mybucket/videos/ ~/Downloads/
```

## Delete Objects

Use the `deletefile` command to delete a single object.

```bash
rclone deletefile waterbear:mybucket/videos/myvideo.mp4
```

Use the `delete` command to delete all object in a folder.

```bash
rclone delete waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

## Print the Total Size of Objects

Use the `size` command to print the total size of objects in a bucket or a folder.

```bash
rclone size waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

## Sync Two Locations

Use the `sync` command to sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesnâ€™t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary.

{% callout type="warning"  %}
Since this can cause data loss, test first with the `--dry-run` flag to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.
{% /callout %}

```bash
rclone sync --progress ~/Videos/ waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

The sync can also be done from Storj to the local file system.

```bash
rclone sync --progress waterbear:mybucket/videos/ ~/Videos/
```

Or between two Storj buckets.

```bash
rclone sync --progress waterbear-us:mybucket/videos/ waterbear-europe:mybucket/videos/
```

Or even between another cloud storage and Storj.

```bash
rclone sync --progress s3:mybucket/videos/ waterbear:mybucket/videos/
```

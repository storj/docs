## Integration guide for connecting Storj to Starfish

[Starfish Storage](https://starfishstorage.com/) is a versatile service designed for file and object management across a wide range of scales, suitable for everything from small departmental file shares to the largest supercomputing file systems. It stands out for its ability to handle vast quantities of data with efficiency and ease, making it a valuable tool for organizations dealing with large and complex data environments.

## Advantages of Starfish with Storj

Integrating Starfish with Storj offers a comprehensive solution for large-scale file management at a competitive cost. Starfish, specializing in metadata-driven file organization and management, integrates smoothly with Storj's S3 compatible API, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of vast data volumes. This combination leverages Storj's robust security features, giving users confidence in the safety and integrity of their data.

## Integration

The integration between Storj and Starfish is achieved through the S3 protocol, which allows Starfish to write and read backup data directly to and from the Storj network. Users can configure Starfish to use Storj as the storage target for their archive jobs.

To integrate Starfish with Storj, you will need:

- An active Storj account
- A bucket for Starfish in your Storj account
- Storj S3 compatible credentials
- Starfish account (see [here](https://starfishstorage.com/contact-us/))

   {% /callout %}

   Run the following command in a terminal:

   ```bash
   # terminal
   # focus
   sf archive-target update Storj default_part_size=64MiB max_part_size=64MiB

   Archive target updated
   id: 44
   name: Storj
   type: s3
   params:
   aws_access_key_id=jusgujwkr4wkoeijgfhbtn465ara
   aws_secret_access_key=***
   bucket_name=sf-test
   default_part_size=64MiB
   dst_path=km-tst
   endpoint_url=https://gateway.storjshare.io
   max_part_size=64MiB
   retries=8
   single_read_on_s3_upload=False
   timeout=60
   ```

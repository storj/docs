## Installation of UpdraftPlus

UpdraftPlus is a common plugin for WordPress. First, you need to [install WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/). You can also use`docker-compose` to [install it locally or on your remote server](https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/).

To download, install and activate the UpdraftPlus plugin, please follow their guide: <https://updraftplus.com/download/>

We will continue configuring the UpdraftPlus plugin after we have created the Gateway MT credentials.

## Generate Gateway MT credentials

Please sign in to your Storj account **Navigate to the Access** page within your project and then click on **Create S3 Credentials**. A modal window will pop up where you should enter a name for this access grant.

**Assign the permissions** you want this access grant to have, then click on **Encrypt My Access.**

**Enter the Encryption Passphrase** you used for your other access grants. If this is your first access grant, we strongly encourage you to use a mnemonic phrase as your encryption passphrase (The GUI automatically generates one on the client-side for you.)

Click either on the **Copy to clipboard** link or **Download .txt** and then confirm that you copied your Encryption Phrase to a safe place.

Copy your **Access Key**, **Secret Key**, and **Endpoint** to a safe location or download them.

Now you are ready to configure **UpdraftPlus** plugin.

## Configuring UpdraftPlus plugin to work with Storj

Now that we have finished generating the Gateway MT credentials, letÂ´s go back to the UpdraftPlus configuration. Once the plugin has been activated, you should open its settings:

2\. Specify a preferred backup schedule for files and/or databases and how many incremental backups you want to have. See <https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/> for more details.

4\. Specify your **Access Key** from your GatewayMT credentials in the **S3 access key** field, your **Access Secret Key** from the GatewayMT credentials in the **S3 secret key** field, **Endpoint** from the GatewayMT credentials in the **S3 end-point** field, and your bucket in the **S3 location** field, select `Path style` in the **Bucket access style** and `Sigv4` as a **Signature version**.

After you successfully configured Storj as your storage back end in the **UpdraftPlus** plugin and saved your configuration, you can return back to the **_Backup / Restore_** tab to start your backup manually right away.

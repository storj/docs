  description:
    Overview of encryption mechanisms in Storj, detailing different levels
    and applications for enhanced application privacy and security.
---

This section describes the encryption mechanisms used on Storj DCS and describes supported approaches to data and metadata encryption.

Separate and distinct from the topic of access management, a number of different levels and applications of strong encryption are applied throughout the Storj DCS service. Within the encryption paradigm, there are design choices that impact the level of privacy and security of an application.

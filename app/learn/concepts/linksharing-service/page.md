## Overview

The Linksharing service provides an easy way to share an object via a web browser. Linkshare links may be shared with the following features:

- **Storj DCS Linkshare web page** - displays a preview of the shared object, including a streaming player for multimedia files along with a map displaying the geolocation of the storage nodes storing the encrypted and erasure coded pieces of the object

- **Custom Domains** - Instead of using the default URL provided by linksharing, users can access their content using a custom domain: [](docId:RI4zz1sLvVEZ4ZcZbuT7l)

- **Path-based linkshare** - displays a list of objects with a shared path in a browser. This feature allows sharing a folder of objects. When clicked in a browser, any of the objects will be displayed individually on a Linkshare web page

- **Direct download Linkshare** - a URL to directly access and download an object via the internet without loading a web page

- **Restricted Access** - Linkshare links are read-only by default, but may be further restricted with any supported [](docId:BvM5lT5lXn3A7BNqs__1w) (bucket, path and prefix, time window)

- **Revokable Access** - Link share links may be revoked by deleting the associated Access Grant from the Auth Service or by revoking the Access Grant via the revocation service.

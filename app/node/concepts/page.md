## Storage Node Concepts

Before running your Storage Node for the first time, please note the Storage Node concepts to be used.

| **Concepts**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `-p`             | How to specify ports - which are points through which information flows between your Node and the Storj network. -p \<host-port>:\<container-port>/tcp -p \<host-port>:\<container-port>/udp /tcpand/udpwill allow your node to connect with the network via both TCP and UDP-p 28967:28967 is the core port used to connect with the network.-p 14002:14002 is the port used for the storage node GUI dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `WALLET`         | A wallet address to receive STORJ token payouts for running the node.&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `EMAIL`          | Email address so that we can notify you when a new version has been released. **(recommended)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ADDRESS`        | External IP address or the DDNS you configured and the port you opened on your router \<ip>:\<port>If you are using a custom port other than 28967, you have to change the -p 28967:28967 to -p \<port>:28967                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `STORAGE`        | How much disk space do you want to allocate to the Storj network? Be sure not to over-allocate space! Allow at least 10% extra for the overhead. If you over-allocate space, you may corrupt your database when the system attempts to store pieces when no more physical space is actually available on your drive. The minimum storage shared requirement is 500 GB, which means you need a disk of at least 550 GB total size to allow for the 10% overhead. If you set up a brand new node, make sure the storage destination folder doesn't already have aconfig.yaml and/or storage folder inside, otherwise the storagenode container could fail to start. |
| `<identity-dir>` | Replace it to the location of your identity files. You can copy the absolute path from the output of the identity commands you ran earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `<storage-dir>`  | Replace it with the local directory where you want files to be stored on your hard drive for the network. Please consider using a subfolder instead of the root of the disk, this could prevent starting from scratch if the disk were to disappear/accidentally disconnect. The network-attached location could work, but it is neither supported nor recommended!&#xA;&#xA;Note: the current database backend is BoltDB which requires mmap, hence you have to use a file system which supports mmap.                                                                                                                                                           |

| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Satellite**                  | Satellites act as the mediator between clients (people up- and downloading data) and Storage Node Operators (people storing data). Satellites facilitate the storage interaction and decide which storage nodes will store which pieces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Bandwidth Used This Month**  | The amount of total bandwidth you've provided to the network since the beginning of the current period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Usage / Repair / Audit**     | Usage bandwidth is the bandwidth a Storage Node uses so customers can download their data, for which a Storage Node Operator is paid $20/TB. Repair bandwidth is the bandwidth usage resulting from regenerating a bad Storage Node's deleted data that is part of the repair process, for which a Storage Node Operator sending the data to new nodes is paid $10/TB. Audit bandwidth is the data downloaded from the Storage Node, which the Satellite uses to measure file durability and Node reputation. |
| **Egress / Ingress**           | Egress is the data the customer downloads from the network. Ingress is the data the network uploads to a Storage Node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Disk Space Used This Month** | The amount of total disk space used on a storage node in the current monthly period, for which a storage node is paid $1.50/TB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Disk Space Remaining**       | The amount of disk space available to use by the network for the remaining month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Uptime Checks**              | Uptime checks occur to make sure a Storage Node is still online. This is the percentage of uptime checks a Storage Node has passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Audit Checks**               | Audit checks occur to make sure the data sent to a Storage Node is still held on the node and intact. This is the audit score, represented as a percentage. With a score, less than 60% node will be disqualified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

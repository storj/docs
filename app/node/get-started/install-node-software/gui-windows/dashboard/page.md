## Introduction

How to monitor the activity of your storage node.

## Storage Node Operator Web Dashboard

When you finish the Windows installation for your Storage Node, a Windows shortcut will automatically be created that will open the [Storage Node Operator Dashboard](https://storj.io/blog/2019/09/introducing-the-storage-node-operator-dashboard/) in your web browser.

You can also access the dashboard by opening the following URL in your web browser:

## Directly on your node:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:14002/
```

### Device on local network:

```Text
http://<your-nodes-local-ip>:14002/
```

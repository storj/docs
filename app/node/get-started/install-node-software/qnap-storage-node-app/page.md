## Introduction

In this guide, we are going to walk through the installation process for the Storage Node QNAP application for your QNAP NAS Device – enabling you to:

1.  Monetize your excess capacity on the Storj Network

2.  Back up your NAS Device to the Network using Gateway-MT and any S3-compatible backup solution.

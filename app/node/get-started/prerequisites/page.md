{% tab label="MacOs" %}
macOS Sierra 10.12 and newer macOS releases are supported

Mac hardware must be a 2010 or newer model

VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 cannot be installed. If you have a newer version of VirtualBox installed, it’s fine.

**Running a node on macOS will require good monitoring. Due to issues with Docker, your node may go offline randomly and require restarting your node.**

{% tab label="Windows" %}
Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 or later.

**If you are currently running a storage node on Windows using the Docker desktop, it will require good monitoring. If you are still running a node with Docker, your node may go offline randomly and require restarting your node, so it is recommended you switch to the **[](docId:5shJebpS3baWj6LDV5ANQ).

## Internet Connection

{% callout type="warning"  %}

## **Do not connect your computer directly to the internet without the assistance of a firewall.** {% anchor=false %}

**Make sure you’re connected to the Internet through a router and not through a modem without a firewall.**

Our software serves requests from the Internet, but not all software you may have installed is designed to be exposed to the Internet directly. This is especially true for users on Windows with applications responding to requests on all IPs.
{% /callout %}

It is highly recommended to have your Storage Node connected via LAN instead of WiFi to ensure a consistent and stable connection.

## Power Supply

If you live in a location where power outages or brownouts are a frequent occurrence, please consider protecting your hardware, including the equipment you run your node on, as well as your router/modem, with an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS). This would help protect against damage to your hardware and against the corruption of your database resulting from abrupt shutdowns, which could lead to the unrecoverable loss of your node.

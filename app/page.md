Welcome to the Storj Documentation!

## What is Storj

Storj is the leading provider of enterprise-grade, globally distributed cloud object storage. It is a drop-in replacement for any S3-compatible object storage that is just as durable but with 99.95% availability and better global performance from a single upload. Storj delivers default multi-region CDN-like performance with zero-trust security at a cost that’s 80% lower than AWS S3. 

Easily integrated into any existing stack with S3 compatibility, Storj is a trustless, globally distributed network that utilizes existing excess storage capacity making enterprise-grade performance, privacy, and resiliency available with compelling economic benefits.

## Main features

Some of the main Storj features include:

| Feature               | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 Compatibility      | Change the endpoint and credentials with an S3-compatible tool of your choice and you’ll be up and running in minutes.                      |
| End-to-End Encryption | Own your data with default encryption and user-assigned access grants so no one can view or compromise your data without permission.        |
| Cost Efficiency       | Multi-region cloud object storage for $4.00 per TB per month. A fraction of the price of a single availability zone from providers like AWS |
| Open Source           | Take advantage of absolute transparency through our open source code. You are not locked-in to our technology or cost structure.            |

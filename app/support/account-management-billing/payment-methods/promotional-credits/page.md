The Storj DCS Service includes incentive programs to encourage adoption and use of the platform. These incentives are operationalized as Promotional Credits and include Credits and Coupons.

## Credits

Credits are a bonus amount that is deposited to a user’s account that the user receives when paying in STORJ token. Credits may be offered from time to time, at varying percentages, at our sole discretion. You will be notified at the time of your deposit if a Credit is offered. Credits are non-refundable and unused Credits expire when you close the account.

### Coupons

“Coupons” are a bonus amount that is deposited to a user’s account that the user may receive as part of a marketing promotion undertaken by us. Like typical coupons, these may be used only for the established period of time to pay for usage fees. Coupons may be offered from time to time, in varying amounts, at the sole discretion of Storj Labs. You will be notified if you receive a Coupon. Coupons are non-refundable, and unused Coupons expire when a user closes an account or at the expiration of the Coupon.

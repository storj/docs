We want all of our users to receive value when they choose the Storj Platform for their storage needs. While we strive to provide world-class service it is possible that a customer may request a refund. Refunds will only be granted based on the circumstances set forth in the [Terms of Use](https://www.storj.io/terms-of-use) and [Terms of Service](https://www.storj.io/terms-of-service). Coupons and Credits are not refundable under any circumstances. Prepayments made via STORJ token transactions are nonrefundable unless an account is being closed.

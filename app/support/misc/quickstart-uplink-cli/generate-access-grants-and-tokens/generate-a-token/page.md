## Introduction

Create an Access Grant in the Uplink CLI with Satellite and API Key info from the Satellite Admin Console

1.  You need to have a satellite account and installed Uplink CLI.

2.  To start, proceed through the initial steps of creating a new Access Grant.

3.  Navigate to **Access** page and click the **Create Keys for CLI** link (rightmost option).

5\. Copy and save the **Satellite Address** and **API Key** in a safe place or download them as they will only appear once.

6\. Make sure you've already [](docId:hFL-goCWqrQMJPcTN82NB) and run `uplink setup`.

{% code-group %}

```windows
./uplink.exe setup
```

```macos
uplink setup
```

```linux
uplink setup
```

{% /code-group %}

{% callout type="info"  %}
For anyone who has previously configured an Uplink, please use a named access. If you want to replace the default access, you need to either specify the `--force` flag to the `uplink setup` command or [](docId:b4-QgUOxVHDHSIWpAf3hG) and use the `uplink access import` command with `--force` flag to import it, or use the `uplink access create --import-to <name>` command with `--force` flag to create an Access Grant in CLI and import it to the specified access in the local store of Uplink.
{% /callout %}

7\. Follow the prompts. When asked for your API Key, enter it (you should have saved it in step 4 above).

8\. Generate the Access Grant by running `uplink access restrict` with no restrictions.

{% callout type="info"  %}
&#x20;If you chose an access name, you'll need to specify it in the following command as `--access=name`
{% /callout %}

{% code-group %}

```windows
./uplink.exe access restrictt --readonly=false
```

```macos
uplink access restrict --readonly=false
```

```linux
uplink access restrict --readonly=false
```

{% /code-group %}

{% callout type="danger"  %}
Keep your full-rights Access Grant secret, it contains the encryption key and will enable uploading, downloading or deleting your data from the entire project!
{% /callout %}

9\. Your Access Grant should have been output.&#x20;

{% callout type="success"  %}
The alternative for using the `uplink setup` command and then `uplink access restrict` is to use the `uplink access create` command instead, it will print the Access Grant right away.
{% /callout %}

You need to have a satellite account and installed Uplink CLI as described in [](docId:TbMdOGCAXNWyPpQmH6EOq)

You can view the geographic distribution of your object and generate a shareable URL via the Link Sharing Service. Run the `uplink share --url` command below.

See [](docId:tBnCSrmR1jbOewG38fIr4)for specifications on how to select an auth region and restrict the `uplink share --url` command.

{% code-group %}

```windows
./uplink.exe share --url --not-after=+2h sj://cakes/cheesecake.jpg
```

```macos
uplink share --url --not-after=+2h sj://cakes/cheesecake.jpg
```

```linux
uplink share --url --not-after=+2h sj://cakes/cheesecake.jpg
```

{% /code-group %}

Copy the URL that is returned by the `uplink share --url` command and paste into your browser window.

```shell

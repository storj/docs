We want all of the users of Storj DCS to be successful and take advantage of the benefits decentralized cloud storage offers. We understand that we'll have a users with a range of different levels of experience, different use cases and different technologies being integrated. If you're having an issue or wondering where to get started, we've got a couple of ways we can help.

## Start with the Documentation

There is a lot of information in the Documentation. The foundational information in under [](docId:wEGJDbEQojQd9A6w4A19I) can be really helpful if you're new to Storj DCS. Most people start with the [](docId:4oDAezF-FcfPr0WPl7knd) section. If you're already an experienced developer, maybe you just want to head straight on over to the [](docId:yYCzPT8HHcbEZZMvfoCFa) section.

If you still need help, we've got a few more options.

## Ask for Help in the [Storj Forum](https://forum.storj.io/)

The [Storj Community](https://forum.storj.io) is a great place to meet other people who are developing using Storj DCS and ask questions. You'll find people with tremendous knowledge about the Storj DCS service, including Storj engineers. If you're stuck on an issue, chances are someone has seen it before or can help you troubleshoot it. Join, browse, ask and answer! There are people on from all over the world, and members of the community, our community mods and Storj engineers are generally pretty quick to respond.

Ok, and if that's not what you're looking for, try the Support KB.

## Check out the Support [Knowledge Base](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us)

We've gotten a lot of questions over the last few years and we've come up with some pretty good answers. A lot of those answers have made it into the documentation or are part of a longer discussion in the Forum. Search the [Support KB](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us) for your issue and see if there is self-service information to get you unblocked.

Alright, and if the Support KB doesn't have what you need, then maybe it's time to reach out to our support team.

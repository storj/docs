When you log into the Satellite Admin Console, you start on the [](docId:k6QwBZM3hnzxkCuQxLOal) for your default Project. A Project is the basic unit for aggregating usage, calculating billing, invoicing fees, collecting payment, and handling access management. Users can create multiple Projects and projects are invoiced separately. Within a Project, usage is tracked at the Bucket level and aggregated for invoicing to the Project. Project names are not client-side encrypted so that they may be rendered in the Satellite user interface. There are two main drivers for creating multiple Projects: access management and billing.

## Delete the existing Project

At the moment the Satellite Admin Console will not allow you to delete a Project.&#x20;

{% callout type="success"  %}
But you can delete all buckets and Access Grants from it and rename it to something like "not used". The empty project costs nothing.
{% /callout %}

If you believe that you need to remove it anyway, then please remove all data and Access Grants from it before [file a support request](https://supportdcs.storj.io/).

{% callout type="warning"  %}
We do not have an access to your data and Access Grants, because they are encrypted, and cannot remove your data on your behalf. So, please, remove them yourself before file a support request. We will ask you to do so anyway.
{% /callout %}

# Code of Conduct

Storj strives to create a welcoming and thriving environment. In order to ensure that every community member is respected and supported, we’ve adopted some general community guidelines.

## Our Pledge

We value diversity and inclusiveness in our community and encourage participation by fostering an open and welcoming environment. We as contributors and maintainers pledge to keep our community respectful and inclusive. By participating in our project, you pledge to keep our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, marital status, body size, appearance, education, level of experience, education, or socioeconomic status.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* This includes, but is not limited to, use of profanity. Please replace those words with other acceptable words. Don’t know what to replace it with? Check out this post.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and agree to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported anonymously or by contacting the project team at conduct@storj.io. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership or maintainers.

# Satellite Console

The "Satellite Console" is the set of services on the Satellite which are primarily concerned with:
* The Satellite UI
* The API used by the Satellite UI
* The external API that can be called by customers with valid credentials, on satellites where it is enabled

While there are relationships between the Satellite Console, and other parts of the Satellite, the Satellite Console does **not** include:
* The Metainfo API used by Uplink/Libuplink
* The Satellite Admin API and UI

# Tracing

Different types of tracing:
- Trace graphs
- Distributed tracing

### Trace graphs

There is a config flag, `debug.trace-out`, that will generate a trace graph for a running process.

For example, a trace graph can be generated for `uplink` download with the following command:

```
$ uplink --debug.trace-out=trace.svg cp sj://bucket/file.test .
```

Then open the `trace.svg` in a browser to view.

The colors in the trace correspond to the following:
- default color: blue
- cancelled: yellow
- error: orange
- panic: red

### Distributed tracing

Distributed tracing support is in progress.

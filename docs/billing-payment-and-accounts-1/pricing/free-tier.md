# Free Plan

Storj DCS currently offers a free level of service to new accounts. When a customer creates a new account, the user automatically is able to use the Storj DCS service at no cost up to specified limits of service. The free level of service is limited to the level of service for a single project as described below:

* 150GB per month of static object storage for a single project. Static object storage is calculated in “terabyte months,” which is a prorated calculation of how much storage is used throughout the month, broken down by hour. Storing 150GB of data for 30 days, 300GB of data for 15 days, or 450GB of data for 10 days, would each be the equivalent to 150GB per month of free storage.
* 150GB of download bandwidth per month for a single project.

Usage for Static Object Storage and Download Bandwidth is calculated in the same way for the Free Plan as for the Pro Plan. A credit against billing will be applied each month for the Free Plan usage for as long as the Free Plan is offered. Accounts using the Free Plan of service are subject to [Project Usage Limits](../../concepts/limits.md).\

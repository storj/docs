# Requesting a Refund

We want all of our users to receive value when they choose the Storj DCS Platform for their storage needs. While we strive to provide world-class service it is possible that a customer may request a refund.  Refunds will only be granted based on the circumstances set forth in the Terms of Use and Terms of Service. Coupons and Credits are not refundable under any circumstances. Prepayments made via STORJ token transactions are nonrefundable unless an account is being closed.\

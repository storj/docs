A Storj access grant is a serialized, self-contained credential that allows users to access a specific bucket, or object, within a Storj project. It encapsulates everything needed for authentication and authorization on the Storj network.

Create Access Grant in the Storj Console:

1. Navigate to **Access** on the left side menu.

2. Click **Create Access Grant** under the Access Grant block

5. Click **Continue** to provide Access encryption Information

   {% callout type="warning"  %}
   In order to see the data uploaded to your bucket in the web console, you must unlock the bucket with the same encryption passphrase as the credentials.
   {% /callout %}

   - **Use the current passphrase**: this is default option

   - **Advanced**: you may provide a different encryption phrase either your own or generate a new one.

     - **Enter a new passphrase**: use this option, if you would like to provide your own new encryption phrase

     - **Generate 12-word passphrase**: use this option, if you would like to generate a new encryption phrase

{% callout type="warning"  %}
**This passphrase is important!** Encryption keys derived from it are used to encrypt your data at rest, and your data will have to be re-uploaded if you want it to change!

Importantly, if you want two access grants to have access to the same data, **they must use the same passphrase**. You won't be able to access your data if the passphrase in your access grant is different than the passphrase you uploaded the data with.

Please note that **Storj does not know or store your encryption passphrase**, so if you lose it, you will not be able to recover your files.
{% /callout %}

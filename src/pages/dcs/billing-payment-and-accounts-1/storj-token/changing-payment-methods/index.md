Users may change payment methods on accounts, but at least one valid payment method must be configured on an account at all times. &#x20;

## Changing Credit Cards

If you want to change the credit card on an account, follow the process outlined above to add a second card under Payment Methods, Add Card.

Once a second card has been added, you may select the new card as the Default card.  It will now be possible to remove the other card.

## Changing from Credit Card to STORJ Token

If you want to pay only in STORJ token, you must not add a credit card and should only have a STORJ token balance on the account. If you previously added a credit card and want to pay using STORJ token instead, follow the instructions above to deposit funds to the account using STORJ token.

If a user wants to remove a credit card that has been added to an account and only use STORJ, the user should add a deposit to the account using the instructions above, then submit a [support request](https://supportdcs.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to remove the credit card.

As described above any invoices will be first debited against the STORJ token payment balance and only if an unpaid balance remains will the credit card be debited.

### Changing from STORJ token to Credit Card

If a user wants to change from paying only in STORJ token to paying with a credit card, the user should add a credit card to the account. Any invoices will be first debited against the remaining STORJ token payment balance and once the balance is exhausted, any unpaid balance remaining will be debited against the credit card. All future payments will then be debited against the credit card.
